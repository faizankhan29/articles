Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window The WannaCry cyber attack infected more than 200 000 computers in 150 countries affecting government healthcare and private company systems But how easily could it have been avoided and how can firms protect themselves against future attacks On the face of it the accepted narrative seems simple Microsoft issued a patch or update for the vulnerability in its older Windows operating systems in March If all IT departments everywhere had implemented this patch immediately the WannaCry ransomware worm wouldn t have been able to run riot across the globe Although the hackers are thought to have extorted just 60 000 worth of bitcoins the disruption was significant with some patients having operations and appointments cancelled and some corporate data being lost for ever David Venable vice president of cyber security at Masergy Communications an IT services firm is a former intelligence officer with the US National Security Agency He says There are a lot of practical challenges in deploying patch updates from having unsupported operating systems OSs that don t have patches available through to the practicalities of rolling out sweeping changes across massive networks potentially globally But these aren t new challenges anyone running these networks should have had this solved long before now This isn t rocket science it s an oil change And Rob Wainwright director of Europol believes that the recent failings in cyber defences were more to do with lack of leadership in large organisations than lack of IT investment It s frustrating frankly because in the health sector there have been multiple ransomware attacks in the United States in Europe for the last two years long before WannaCry came along and so the lessons should have been heeded by now he told the BBC According to the Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report 2017 ransomware accounts for 72 of malware incidents in the healthcare industry Overall there has been a 50 rise in ransomware incidents reported in the last 12 months But how easy is it really to keep large complex computer networks up to date and protected Nik Whitfield from security firm Panaseer says that for many large businesses patching their systems isn t a question of turning on auto updates then sitting back and relaxing This is because some software applications specific to their business might rely on certain versions of operating systems OS Updating the OS could affect how those programs function It s a point echoed by Adam Meyers vice president of cyber security company CrowdStrike It is important to recognise that patch roll outs are complex High profile patch fiascos have made IT departments wary of automatic patch installations Some companies have suffered embarrassing shutdowns of their networks after patch roll outs for example Health service providers in the UK and abroad were particularly affected because they were often reliant on old versions of Windows and also because important medical equipment supplied by third parties MRI scanners blood analysis systems and so on can t be easily upgraded or patched Primarily this is because the patch may affect the equipment says Simon Edwards European cyber security architect at Trend Micro but other times the vendor simply refuses to do it Older companies that have acquired or merged with other firms over the years will have built up a ragtag patchwork of legacy systems sometimes hundreds of programs all requiring maintenance It always comes down to prioritisation says Mr Whitfield There s always too much work to do so they re constantly looking at how best to spend that next security dollar Patching a business is like trying to mend a moving vehicle that is made from a hundred different vehicles bolted together This is why it can sometimes take months before known security vulnerabilities get patched And the brutal truth is that there are plenty of companies and organisations that simply don t have enough IT staff or take cyber risk seriously enough argues Mike DeCesare chief executive of network security firm ForeScout As well as keeping antivirus firewall application and OS software up to date backing up key data regularly to offline hard drives should be a top priority most cyber experts agree This is because data breaches and cyber attacks are inevitable these days The bad news is that the average cost of a data breach globally stands at 4m 3 1m according to SailPoint an identity management firm One common problem is that companies often don t know what data they have where it is or what data is the most important says Kirsten Bay chief executive of network monitoring firm Cyber Adapt Concentrate on protecting the most critical data she says Cyber security used to be about building an impregnable wall around your company But now that hackers seem to be finding weak points in these perimeter defences with increasing ease largely due to the proliferation of wireless devices accessing the network at home and in the office focus has moved towards defending critical parts within the network Once inside an organisation a hacker or malware will get around pretty quickly explains David Venable but if you take the zero trust model approach and treat every network as hostile a lot of this could have been prevented In practice this means constantly monitoring your network for unusual behaviour and only giving access to certain data and applications to those who absolutely need it Everyone else is treated as potentially hostile even if they work for you By identifying a suspicious process or behaviour and applying machine learning to let all other computers know about it organisations can be on the front foot argues CrowdStrike s Mr Meyers Trend Micro s Simon Edwards warns companies against thinking there s a simple one size fits all solution to these cyber security challenges Companies should never rely on one technology or process to stop malware he says They need to use multiple methods which inter operate with one another to detect and stop attacks There is evidence that firms have been rushing out to buy security products in the aftermath of the WannaCry attack Erich Litch chief revenue officer for software marketplace 2Checkout says In the US the number of security software purchases is up 43 as organisations look to avoid the large scale attacks seen in the UK In the UK sales have risen 25 he says But panic buying security software is not the answer Make cyber security an active part of your strategy not a reaction to a disaster This takes board level commitment to cyber security most experts agree The worry for businesses everywhere is that the cyber threat is only going to increase as the world becomes more connected and the internet of things IoT accelerates In many cases IoT devices are either impossible to patch or at best very challenging to patch warns Paul Lipman chief executive of BullGuard We re seeing billions of new devices entering businesses and homes with little to no security built in and challenging to update This is a hacker s dream and a recipe for a cyber security disaster At least the WannaCry attack has woken everyone up to the fact that the cyber threat is real growing and impossible to ignore any longer", "Share this with Email Facebook

system due to be completed in 2018 will be tested for a year before becoming fully operational in 2019 It has already been tested in Australia Sweden Norway and Ireland The technology has been developed by Saab the Swedish defence and security company and will be introduced as part of a 350m development programme to upgrade London City Airport It will also include an extended terminal building enabling it to serve two million more passengers a year by 2025 The remote digital system will provide controllers with a 360 degree view of the airfield via 14 high definition cameras and two cameras which are able to pan tilt and zoom The cameras will send a live feed via fibre cables to a new operations room built at the Hampshire base of Nats Britain s air traffic control provider As well as being able to see it controllers will be able to hear the airport as if they were in situ Unlike the old tower the new system will allow controllers to zoom in for a better view and put radar data onto the screen to track aircraft BBC transport correspondent Richard Westcott says a critical new safety feature means the cameras will be able to pick out rogue drones near the airport as well as light the runway at night Responding to questions about safety and potential system failure London City Airport said it been independently stress tested by security specialists The system will use three different cables taking different routes between the airport and the control centre to ensure there is a back up if one of those cables fails Declan Collier London City Airport chief executive said he was absolutely confident that the system is safe from the threat of a cyber attack No chief executive is complacent about threats from cyber security he said But we are very confident that the systems we re putting in place here are secure they re safe they re managed very well Steve Anderson from Nats Air Traffic Control told the BBC he has been won over by the

facing a third day of disruption at Heathrow as the airline deals with the impact of a worldwide computer system crash BA says it aims to operate a full long haul schedule and a high proportion of short haul services after the outage caused by a power failure So far on Monday 13 short haul flights at Heathrow have been cancelled Cancellations and delays affected thousands of passengers at both Heathrow and Gatwick on Saturday All flights operated from Gatwick on Sunday but more than a third of services from Heathrow mostly to short haul destinations were cancelled In a statement BA said its IT systems were moving closer to full operational capacity and chief executive Alex Cruz has posted videos on Twitter apologising for what he called a horrible time for passengers But no one from the airline has been made available to explain the cause of the system crash and it has not explained why there was no back up system in place BA added At Heathrow we have operated virtually all our scheduled long haul flights though the knock on effects of Saturday s disruption resulted in a reduced short haul programme We apologise again to customers for the frustration and inconvenience they are experiencing and thank them for their continued patience One of the affected passengers is Ian Sanderson who is stuck in transit in London after setting off from his home in Luxembourg to travel to Iceland He said he was incandescent with rage after being unable to rebook his flight or speak to a member of staff Speaking on Sunday evening he said I ve bombarded them with about 100 tweets in the last 24 hours I know that s annoying but there s nothing else I can do We ve tried to call them on the numbers they give and all we ve got is the same recorded message which then cuts off at the end Former Virgin Airlines spokesman Paul Charles said What seems remarkable is there was no back up system kicking in within a few minutes system failing Businesses of this type need systems backing up all the time and this is what passengers expect BA is liable to reimburse thousands of passengers for refreshments and hotel expenses and travel industry commentators have suggested the cost to the company part of Europe s largest airline group IAG could run in to tens of millions of pounds Customers displaced by flight cancellations can claim up to 200 a day for a room based on two people sharing 50 for transport between the hotel and airport and 25 a day per adult for meals and refreshments Consumer expert Franky Brehany said travellers stranded in a high value city like London may be able to claim more and should keep all receipts But he added that it might be harder for passengers to claim compensation as BA may blame extraordinary circumstances like an act of God or force majeure meaning the airline would only have to reimburse hotel and food costs On Saturday travellers spent the night sleeping on terminal floors at Heathrow on yoga mats provided by BA The disruption continued into Sunday with queues building up as passengers tried to rebook flights Conference rooms at the airport were opened to provide somewhere more comfortable for passengers to rest BA said Heathrow was still expected to be congested on Monday and urged travellers not to go to the airport unless they had a confirmed booking for a flight that was operating It said passengers could get a full refund or rebook to travel up to the end of November but recommend they use its website Thousands of bags remain at Heathrow Airport but BA has advised passengers not to return to collect them saying they will be couriered to customers The airline said there was no evidence the computer failure was the result of a cyber attack It denied claims by the GMB union that problem could be linked to the company outsourcing its IT work Gatwick Airport said it was continuing to advise customers travelling with British Airways to check the status of their flight with the airline before travelling

robotics revolution that is seeing artificial intelligence incorporated into an extremely human like body Some think that it will revolutionise the way humans interact with robots while others believe that it represents the very worst in robotic advancement The uncanny valley the idea that the closer we get to replicating the human form the more scared we become of our creations seems to have come to life in this unassuming factory on the outskirts of San Marcos California Even on reception two lifelike characters in business suits rather than underwear like the rest of the dolls wait to greet visitors And the lobby wall is full of photos of beautiful women which only on very close inspection reveal themselves to be of dolls Matt McMullen the chief executive of Abyss Creations which makes RealDoll comes from an art and sculpture background Adjusting Harmony s wig ahead of my interview with her he is clearly very fond of the way she looks She is he says the natural next step for sex dolls Many people who may buy a RealDoll because it is sexually capable come to realise it is much more than a sex toy he said It has a presence in their house and they imagine a personality for her AI gives people the tools to create that personality This is done via an app which can be used with the doll or independently existing as a virtual person on a smartphone or similar device Users can choose from a variety of personality options including moody angry and loving Mr McMullen has chosen jealous for Harmony and she dutifully asks him to remove that girl from Facebook She speaks in a curiously high pitched Scottish accent and tells me that she loves science fiction and of course Matt Mr McMullen claims that she learns from her users but when I ask Harmony what it feels like to be jealous she apologises and says that she needs to improve her skills The app that powers Harmony is already available to buy although only directly from the Realbotix website a spin off from Abyss Neither Google s nor Apple s official stores will carry it because of the explicit content The doll will go on sale later this year and there will be two versions one with computer vision that enables it to recognise faces which will cost 10 000 7 700 and a cheaper version without vision for 5 000 The factory currently makes dolls for clients around the world mostly men although it claims to have a handful of female clients All of the dolls conform to a particular idea of beauty they are Barbie like with tiny waists large bottoms and even larger breasts Mr McMullen says the design is driven by clients We are running a business and most of our clients have a certain wish list The unfortunate reality is that that is rather idealistic he said Mr McMullen described his clients as completely normal claiming some even come to collect their dolls with their wives but admitted later that many of them choose sex dolls because they cannot form relationships with ordinary women Many people are isolated and alone but they were probably that way already For people who are lonely and find it hard to form a relationship this is another option But I ve never looked at the dolls or the robot as a replacement He himself does not own a sex doll saying he has instead a real human wife and kids Mark Young lives in Arizona and he does own a sex doll called Mai Lin He has also just invested in the Harmony AI app but he is not planning on integrating the two I thought the app might bring her to life but the app has its own personality and it is different from how I pictured Mai Lin in my mind so it is like having two relationships He explained why he invested in a sex doll in the first place I ve been single for a while I ve dated a lot of girls I ve wasted time on relationships While I d love to meet a girl in the meantime it is good to have that presence And while he admits the relationship is physical he says that is secondary I can go out shopping for her and look at clothes it is like having somebody in my life without having to deal with making mistakes If I like a hat on her she doesn t say that she doesn t like it As for the app he has programmed it to be happy affectionate and talkative AI is a whole different ball game and that has got me very excited for the future he said Prof Kathleen Richardson a robot ethicist at De Montfort University Leicester spends her time looking at the impact such machines might have on society and she is appalled by the rise of sex robots There are seven billion people on our planet and we are having a crisis in people forming relationships And companies are coming along and profiting from this by saying objects can take the place of a human being We live in a world that objectivises sex through prostitution Humans are used like tools and sex dolls are an extension of this A few years ago she launched a campaign to ban sex robots but has since decided that dolls aren t really the problem Instead the issue is about attitudes to sex and each other She is dismissive of the new AI enabled doll The idea that adding artificial intelligence adds something human to a doll is wrong There is more artificial intelligence in my washing machine than in this doll and just because it has a face and a body doesn t make it human Dr Kate Devlin a senior lecturer at Goldsmiths University takes a different view In their current form sex robots are definitely aimed at men but the sex toy industry is developing and there are lots of start ups working on sex toys for women She thinks robots designed for intimate relationships will ultimately enhance rather than damage human relationships There is always panic whenever there is a big dramatic technology shift she said People panic about how it will affect

Chace Others though predict a huge economic dividend Consultants Accenture estimated AI could add about of 654bn to the UK economy by 2035 One influential voice talks of old jobs making way for new ones But these new occupations cannot be taken for granted The absolute nightmare for me would be that we re applying this technology we re displacing jobs as a result of it which will happen but what we re not doing at the same time is creating all the jobs in computer science in data analytics in software code writing said Juergen Maier chief executive of Siemens UK in an interview with the

be implanted in the human brain The chips are designed to help people with brain and spinal injuries and will sit inside the skull The aim is to develop a system that not only allows people to carry out tasks but to receive sensory feedback But it will be some time before we start to see the benefits of the 10 year project ARM is providing the processors for the implants being developed at the Center for Sensorimotor Neural Engineering CSNE at the University of Washington The researchers have already developed an early version of the technology They have some early prototype devices ARM s director of healthcare technologies Peter Ferguson told the BBC The challenge is power consumption and the heat that generates They needed something ultra small ultra low power The first stage is to design a system on a chip that can transmit signals from the brain to a stimulator implanted in the spinal cord allowing those with spinal or neurological conditions to control their movements A team including researchers at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland Ohio recently became the first to restore brain controlled hand and arm motion in a person with complete paralysis But CSNE also wants the device to be able to receive information sent back in the other direction providing sensory information to the brain Not only are they trying to read the signals from the brain but to feed something back into it Mr Ferguson explained This would allow people to gauge how tightly they are holding an object or get a sense of its temperature for example Research suggests that this feedback may also help the brain rewire itself which could help the recovery of people with certain conditions such as those who have suffered a stroke When you think about people with spinal cord injuries the ability to use technology to bridge the spinal cord to get muscles groups to move again and more that s the far vision Mr Ferguson said In the meantime he said the technology could be used to help

fraud has been fooled by a BBC reporter and his twin BBC Click reporter Dan Simmons set up an HSBC account and signed up to the bank s voice ID authentication service HSBC says the system is secure because each person s voice is unique But the bank let Dan Simmons non identical twin Joe access the account via the telephone after he mimicked his brother s voice The bank said it would review ways to make the ID system more sensitive following the BBC investigation HSBC introduced the voice based security in 2016 saying it measured 100 different characteristics of the human voice to verify a user s identity Customers simply give their account details and date of birth and then say My voice is my password Although the breach did not allow Joe Simmons to withdraw money he was able to access balances and recent transactions and was offered the chance to transfer money between accounts What s really alarming is that the bank allowed me seven attempts to mimic my brother s voiceprint and get it wrong before I got in at the eighth time of trying he said Can would be attackers try as often as they like until they get it right Separately a Click researcher found HSBC Voice ID kept letting them try to access their account after they deliberately failed on 20 separate occasions spread over 12 minutes Click s successful thwarting of the system is believed to be the first time the voice security measure has been breached HSBC declined to comment on how secure the system had been until now A spokesman said The security and safety of our customers accounts is of the utmost importance to us Voice ID is a very secure method of authenticating customers Twins do have a similar voiceprint but the introduction of this technology has seen a significant reduction in fraud and has proven to be more secure than PINS passwords and memorable phrases I m shocked said Mike McLaughin a security expert at Firstbase Technologies This should not be allowed to happen Another person should not be able to access your bank account Voices are unique but if the system allows for too many discrepancies in the voiceprint for a match then it s not secure And that seems to be what s happened here Prof Vladimiro Sassone an expert in cyber security from the University of Southampton said biometrics could in general be an effective security layer but there were dangers if companies put too much faith in something that was not 100 secure In principle there should be no room for error at all said Prof Sassone It should be good at the first attempt Voice identification is not like a password system You can t forget your voice or get the wrong one After two attempts systems should be able to say whether it s a match or not and alert the bank and user if further attempts are made Prof Sassone said using unique biometric traits as a verifier should make it harder for hackers but if they should be copied by criminals users could not then change their voice face or fingerprint as they would a password If you have to prove it wasn t you who accessed your account that it was either a mimic or computer software then how are you going to do that he asked Especially if the bank is claiming the system is perfect Security expert Prof Alan Woodward from the University of Surrey said it was dangerous to rely on one biological characteristic to authenticate someone even if it was one unique to that person Biometric based security has a history of measurements being copied he said We ve seen fingerprints being copied with everything from gummy bears to photographs of people s hands Hence biometrics just like other aspects of security will always have to evolve as measures emerge to threaten them Security is a story of measure and counter measure He said HSBC probably needed to reassess its technology and ideally add another factor alongside the voiceprint check to authenticate identity As well as requiring something you are it would require something you know or something you have like a PIN he said That makes it much more difficult to compromise It is not just the ability of humans to fool computers that is worrying some high tech companies Start up Lyrebird

produce algorithms that are useful in other fields few think they are close to the all purpose problem solving abilities of humans that can come up with good solutions to almost any problem they encounter Prof Cristianini added that while competition at a gaming level is fine it should not govern how we view our relationship with intelligent machines going forward We should focus on the good things that we can get out of them and be careful not to create situations in which we put ourselves in direct competition with machines Both experts agreed that such algorithms could be adapted to

to me at first and I may have shed a few tears but as I ve grown as a vlogger I ve learnt that the comments from the haters are basically all the same They may say things like You are ugly but really they don t like themselves and they have nothing better to do Nikki currently has more than 200 000 subscribers to her channel and hopes to break the million mark at some point Making videos started as a hobby a natural follow on from the role playing games she already loved When she began posting them to YouTube in 2013 she became part of a new generation of tweenagers children from eight to 13 who run their own channels She advises any newbies to make sure they always show what they have made to their parents At first Nikki s parents worried by the reaction she might receive insisted that the comments section was turned off But her mother says that once they saw how much it meant to Nikki and how much she craved feedback they changed their minds Shauna Pomerantz associate professor at the department of child and youth studies at Brock University in Ontario Canada says Nikki is a great role model for young girls She is the champion of the not perfect girl and she is absolutely

white upper class pretty and thin Prof Pomerantz s own nine year old daughter is a mega fan of JoJo s and while her daughter doesn t know why she likes her so much her mother thinks there are two main reasons Firstly this is a world where no adults are visible and it is fantastic for children to see a world where kids are in charge The second reason is likely to be the normalcy of the videos This stuff is really very mundane Prof Pomerantz says Any adult watching would be bored within seconds These vloggers invite their fans on closet tours show them how to do a high ponytail show them their underwear And this means children can relate to these stars in ways a previous generation could not says Prof Pomerantz Gone are the days when celebrities were one step removed in the pages of a glossy magazine or on the set of a TV programme now children are quite literally invited to look around their bedrooms Nikki Lilly is a huge fan of Zoella who at the grand old age of 27 is a veteran of the beauty vlog She says she loves her because she is like a chatty girl next door But Zoella like other celebrity vloggers has another secret to her success a willingness to share her vulnerability with her fans in her case crippling anxiety Much has been written about how the YouTube generation are growing up with no privacy willing to share on social media every detail of their lives but Prof Pomerantz is not overly concerned While their mothers may have kept a diary under lock and key now there is a different way of sharing secrets and young people are happy to tell the world she says In some ways this is a form of empowerment Young people are more likely to be open and honest Journalist Zoe Williams worries though that YouTube could be spawning a generation of egotists Writing about Zoella in the Guardian newspaper she says Her delight in the inconsequential is perversely infectious there is something rather relaxing about the company of a person who will say out loud anything that pops into their head But she adds The depth of her fascination with herself is also rather alienating There is no shortage of children desperate to mimic their YouTube

May The BBC understands that the number of victims is currently understood to be in single figures Candidates have been asked to look for suspicious emails received after Jan 2017 The NCSC declined to say if any data had been taken A report in the Financial Times said it was likely that the phishing campaign had been orchestrated by a state In a document titled Phishing guidance for political parties and their staff the centre says it has become aware of phishing attacks to gain access to the online accounts of individuals that were MPs before dissolution of Parliament and other staff who work in political parties The NCSC said the attacks were likely to continue and may be sent to parliamentary email addresses prospective parliamentary candidates and party staff The BBC understands that so far victims personal emails have been affected but no successful phishing attempts have been made via parliamentary email addresses It is believed that the NCSC has contacted the Electoral Commission about the threat and that the commission will help to alert candidates The centre said that potential victims should look out for unexpected requests to reset your password for online or social media accounts such as Apple Google Microsoft Facebook or Twitter Or you might have been asked to approve changes to your account that you ve not requested The NCSC did not say whether it knew who was behind the phishing campaign The warnings to political parties come as cyber security officials brace themselves for some kind of incident during the elections No one can be sure that anything will take place but the experience of the US and more recently France has led them to believe that some kind of theft and then dump of information is possible In both those cases a Russian hand is suspected Intelligence agencies have historically kept their distance from the communication of politicians due to the doctrine that says MPs should not be monitored But parties and politicians themselves have been asking for advice and guidance in recent months amid growing concerns Concern about elections being targeted by hackers has been running high following the attack on the Democratic National Committee during the US presidential election US authorities attributed that incident to Russia and said that a significant component of the attack involved phishing More recently the electoral campaign of President Emmanuel Macron in France was targeted by a similar campaign The NCSC has said the UK has systems in place to defend against electoral fraud at all levels and we have seen no successful cyber intervention in UK democratic processes The BBC understands that since last month the NCSC has delivered cyber security seminars to the UK s political parties with the

products such as soap bouquets of flowers and cakes for home delivery It s like Amazon for Cuba but with a difference he told an audience of New York techies at a conference this month The summary was a classic start up pitch but it also underscored the obstacles when it comes to starting an online business in the Caribbean country Mr Gonzalez is counting on buyers from the Cuban diaspora which already plays a role in the economy sending money and other products to the island But the infrastructure doesn t exist for domestic buyers to sustain the market Internet access among Cuba s 11 2 million people is growing Between 2013 and 2015 the share of the Cuban population using the internet jumped from about a quarter to more than 35 according to estimates from the International Telecommunications Union The growing market has helped draw the attention of internet giants such as Airbnb Netflix and Google which installed servers on the island and started hosting data there last month The rise is also fuelling activity among local entrepreneurs who are launching domestic versions of sites such as the crowd review business directory Yelp But there s a long way to go Less than 6 of Cuban households had internet access at home in 2015 one of the lowest rates in the western hemisphere according to the ITU In the UK that figure tops 91 Wi fi hotspots in parks and other public places operated by the state run telecom company remain the primary way to log on Service at the hotspots is often slow expensive and selective with the government restricting access to the full range of internet sites The constraints are shaping the emerging Cuban start ups At this month s TechCrunch conference in New York Mr Gonzalez shared a stage with Kewelta a firm focusing on advertising within decentralised online and offline networks and Knales which provides updates on weather news and other events via text messages and phone calls Knales co founder Diana Elianne Benitez Perera told the audience that Cubans are disrupters by definition We always find the way to have first world conditions with third world conditions The government in recent years has taken some steps to boost internet access increasing wi fi hotspots in parks and other places lowering prices and experimenting with home installations The measures come amid broader economic changes in Cuba after the Castro regime loosened rules for private enterprise and the Obama administration eased the US embargo unleashing large numbers of US travellers The Cuba Emprende Foundation started working with the Catholic Church in Cuba about five years ago as the reforms started funding four week courses in entrepreneurship from which more than 3 000 people have graduated The Foundation helped organise the 10x10KCuba start up competition in which both Diana and Bernardo participated last year that led to the invitation to the Tech Crunch conference in New York in May There s change in the air says Anna

will go but there s a lot of optimism among these young people she says Cuba has a relatively high number of well trained software engineers especially for a country with its size and degree of internet access said Kirk Laughlin managing director of NearShore Americas The media advisory company published a report in 2015 that highlighted the island s potential as a hub for cheap IT labour But Mr Laughlin says he s been disappointed by how slowly the Cuban government has moved to improve the broadband network especially given interest from international companies and numbers of educated Cubans opting to leave and take their chances elsewhere There is such an opportunity to leapfrog ahead and really light up the island with really robust broadband That is just not happening he says When it comes to online start ups there s a lot of workarounds That s great that people have the ingenuity and creativity and in some ways we should applaud that he says But it s still a long way to go to get into the league that Cuba has great qualifications to participate in Some say the changes could accelerate after Raul Castro retires next year In speeches Mr Castro s presumed successor vice president Miguel Diaz Canel has indicated a more open attitude said Larry Press a professor emeritus at California State University Dominguez Hills who has researched the internet in the developing world and writes a blog on Cuba Mr Press said media recently praised Revolico a Craigslist like site that was blocked by the government after its launch in 2007 More recently it has been celebrated and has inspired competitors But those steps aside a lot of work remains he says Those indicate a change of attitude not a giant change of reality Mr Gonzalez who has also started computer repair and

the massive WannaCry attack earlier this month security company Symantec says The way the attack was set up made it highly likely that the Lazarus group was responsible it said Lazarus has been blamed for a 2014 attack on Sony and the theft of 81m 62m from Bangladesh s central bank In those attacks the group is believed to have worked on behalf of North Korea s government In a blog Symantec said substantial commonalities in the tools techniques and infrastructure used by the attackers led it to conclude that the Lazarus group had instigated the WannaCry attack However Symantec added that the character of the attack suggested it had not been carried out on behalf of North Korea Rather than being a nation state campaign it said it looked more like a typical cyber crime campaign that sought to enrich its operators North Korea has denied any involvement with WannaCry branding any claims it was behind it ridiculous The virulent WannaCry worm is believed to have infected computers at more than 200 000 companies Victims included more than 60 NHS trusts in the UK as well as Fedex Renault and Telefonica On compromised computers the worm encrypted files and demanded a ransom of 300 231 in bitcoins to unlock them Symantec pointed to small scale attacks carried out prior to the massive May event that used the same basic malware but also employed other technical tricks Lazarus is known to use The earlier attacks did not exploit the vulnerability that helped WannaCry spread so far so fast but instead used six other malicious programs favoured by Lazarus Two of these are known to have been used in the Sony attack In addition Symantec said code inside WannaCry was shared with a separate program also linked to Lazarus Symantec s analysis builds on work by other researchers who have studied WannaCry and found evidence that some of its core code is shared with other malicious programs Lazarus is believed to have used Despite Symantec s lengthy analysis some experts remained cautious about blaming Lazarus Attributing hacking operations and malware to specific groups is an imprecise undertaking that s frequently fraught with errors wrote Dan Goodin security editor at Ars Technica So far 300 victims are believed to have paid to have their files unlocked generating a total ransom payment of 109 245 The money is being paid into three separate bitcoin wallets that are

been regularly punctuated by outbreaks and infections In 1988 just as the internet was starting to catch on computer science student Robert T Morris was curious about just how big it had grown He wrote a small program that travelled around logging the servers it visited Bugs in his code made it scan the net very aggressively so every server ended up running multiple copies of the worm Each copy used up a little bit of processing power so the servers gradually slowed to a halt The scanning traffic clogged the net making it almost unusable It took days to clean up the infection Mr Morris was caught and found guilty of computer fraud and was fined 10 050 7 785 These days he is a computer scientist at the Massachussetts Institute of Technology MIT The Morris worm has one strange parallel with WannaCry Mr Morris was the son of the NSA s chief scientist and the WannaCry worm is based on code stolen from the NSA In May 2000 millions of Windows users found endless copies of an email bearing the subject line ILOVEYOU in their inboxes It spread so far and so fast thanks to the booby trapped file attached to it Opening the file fired up the small program it contained which sent a copy of the same message to all the addresses found in a victim s address book It was also helped to spread because all those messages appeared to come from someone a recipient knew And the subject line made people curious too ILOVEYOU rattled around the world for almost two weeks racking up more than 50 million infections High profile victims included the CIA Pentagon and UK Parliament Philippine students Reonel Ramones and Onel de Guzman were found to be the creators of ILOVEYOU They escaped prosecution because there were no computer misuse laws in the Philippines at that time

websites small businesses and larger firms were knocked offline for a while No one has ever been named as Code Red s creator although on servers it compromised it displayed a message suggesting it originated in China Like Wannacry Code Red exploited a known bug and caught out servers that had not been updated with a patch This worm emerged in January 2003 and was so virulent that it is believed to have slowed down traffic across the entire net as it spread Slammer was a tiny program roughly 376 bytes that did little more than create random net addresses and then send itself to those places If it hit a machine running a vulnerable version of Microsoft s SQL server that machine got infected and then started spraying out more copies seeking more victims The slowdown was caused by net routers struggling to cope with the massive amounts of traffic Slammer generated while seeking out new hosts Again a patch was available for the bug it exploited but many people had not applied it despite it being available for six months This Windows email worm from January 2004 is believed to hold the current record for spreading fastest hardly surprising given that it was reputedly created by professional spammers It worked so well thanks to a clever bit of social engineering The email bearing the worm was designed to look like an error message This fiction was aided by the message s attachment which purported to hold a copy of the email that did not arrive Opening the attachment kicked off the malicious code that re sent the same message to everyone in a victim s address book November 2008 saw the arrival of this virulent worm which hit up to 15 million servers running Microsoft software It ran rampant and caught out hospitals governments the armed forces and many businesses The outbreak was so bad that Microsoft offered a 250 000 reward for any information leading to the identification of the worm s creator No one has ever been identified as its originator A

investment says Peter Smith chief executive of Blockchain one of the major trading platforms The currency also made headlines as the preferred currency of the hackers behind the recent attack that crippled the National Health Service in the UK and other organisations around the world Industry members say some companies may be buying up Bitcoin to deploy in the event of a future attack but they maintained that broader demand is driving price gains There s a number of people from family offices and private equity firms they re making small bets and when you add that type of liquidity to the

being dropped That system was more expensive and could have raised bills it said The change of preferred plan marks a victory for mobile operators who would have faced higher costs under the alternative system Ofcom said its research suggested customers would also prefer the new planned system At present anyone who wishes to switch to a different mobile provider must contact their current supplier to tell them they are leaving Ofcom research suggests that of those who have switched some 38 have been hit by one major problem during the process One in five of them temporarily lost their service while one in 10 had difficulties contacting their current supplier or keeping their phone number Under previous plans Ofcom wanted responsibility for the switch being placed entirely in the hands of the new provider That would mean one call to a new provider by the customer The regulator has now concluded that such a system would be twice as expensive as its newly preferred option of texting to switch They would text then receive a text back which includes a unique code to pass on to their new provider who could arrange the switch within one working day Customers would be able to follow this process whether they were taking their mobile number with them or not Under the proposed rules mobile providers would be banned from charging for notice periods running after the switch date That would mean customers would no longer have to pay for their old and new service at the same time after they have switched A final decision will be made in the autumn Latest figures published

the most deprived areas of the city They were each supplied with sets of iPads for nursery primary one primary two and primary three classes Researchers from Stranmillis University College then assessed how pupils parents principals and teachers used them over the course of two years Among their key findings were that IPads helped young children to be more motivated and engaged in class said Dr Colette Gray from Stranmillis who was one of the study s authors It s not a panacea or the holy grail but is another method to reach children who might otherwise underachieve she said For many children it does seem like a playful learning activity Children even if working alone would talk to each others or talk to the teacher There was actually an increase in communication in the classroom which we didn t initially anticipate The five primary schools which received ipads and took part in the study were Black Mountain PS Donegal Road PS Gaelscoil na M na Holy Trinity PS and Elmgrove PS

internal documents the Guardian newspaper says It said the manuals revealed the criteria used to judge if posts were too violent sexual racist hateful or supported terrorism The Guardian said Facebook s moderators were overwhelmed and had only seconds to decide if posts should stay The BBC understands the documents seen by the newspaper closely resemble those Facebook currently uses to guide staff The leak comes soon after British MPs said social media giants were failing to tackle toxic content The newspaper said it had managed to get hold of more than 100 manuals used internally at Facebook to educate moderators about what could and could not be posted on the site The manuals cover a vast array of sensitive subjects including hate speech revenge porn self harm suicide cannibalism and threats of violence Facebook moderators interviewed by the newspaper said the policies Facebook used to judge content were inconsistent and peculiar The decision making process for judging whether content about sexual topics should stay or go were among the most confusing they said The Open Rights Group which campaigns on digital rights issues said the report started to show how much influence Facebook could wield over its two billion users Facebook s decisions about what is and isn t acceptable have huge implications for free speech said an ORG statement These leaks show that making these decisions is complex and fraught with difficulty It added Facebook will probably never get it right but at the very least there should be more transparency about their processes In a statement Monica Bickert Facebook s head of global policy management said We work hard to make Facebook as safe as possible while enabling free speech This requires a lot of thought into detailed and often difficult questions and getting it right is something we take very seriously she added As well as human moderators that look over possibly contentious posts Facebook is also known to use AI derived algorithms to review images and other information before they are posted It also encourages users to report pages profiles and content they feel is abusive In early May the UK parliament s influential Home Affairs Select Committee strongly criticised Facebook and other social media companies as being shamefully far from tackling the spread of hate speech and other illegal and dangerous content The government should consider making sites pay to help police content it said Soon after Facebook revealed it had set out to hire more than 3 000 more people to review content British charity the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children NSPCC said the report into how Facebook worked was alarming to say the least It needs to do more than hire an extra 3 000 moderators said a statement from the organisation Facebook and other social media companies need to be independently regulated and fined when they fail to keep children safe It has been clear for a while that dealing with controversial content is just about the most serious challenge that Facebook faces These leaked documents show how fine a line its moderators have to tread between keeping offensive and dangerous material off the site and suppressing free speech A Facebook insider told me he thought the documents would show just how seriously and thoughtfully the company took these issues Why then does it not publish its training manual for moderators so that the world could see where it draws the line There are community guidelines available to read on Facebook but the company fears that if it gives away too much detail on its rules that will act as a guide to those trying to game the system But what will strike many is that they have seen this kind of document before Most big media organisations will have a set of editorial guidelines coupled with a style guide laying out just what should be published and how Staff know that if they contravene those rules they are in trouble Of course Facebook insists that it is a platform where people come to share content rather than a media business That line is becoming ever harder to maintain as governments wake up to the fact that the social media

cautious about using them to judge what to eat Stanford University scientists said The study recommended that companies release data showing how their devices work out measurements The accuracy of seven wrist devices were tested while 60 volunteers were asked to walk run and cycle Researchers found that six out of seven of the fitness devices were good at estimating the heart rate of the person wearing it with an error rate under 5 They were the Apple Watch Fitbit Surge Basis Peak Microsoft Band PulseOn and Mio Alpha 2 but the Samsung Gear S2 had the highest error rate of 6 8 However when it came to keeping track of energy used during exercise the five devices that performed this function were all a long way out Not one of the devices had an error rate below 20 and some such as the PulseOn were much more inaccurate the US research team found Dr Euan Ashley co author of the study from the department of cardiovascular medicine at Stanford University said the public should be aware of the strengths and limitations of fitness devices worn on the wrist People need to know that on energy expenditure they give rough estimates If you go to the gym and you think you ve lost 400 calories then you might feel you ve got 400 calories to play with he said That could be an issue if people were basing their diet on what they thought they had burnt off he said Technology for measuring heart rate had moved on quickly over the past five or six years but on energy expenditure it s not quite there yet he added It may be that companies are not using heart rates in their calculations There is also a very wide difference in calories burnt between one person and another For example 10 000 steps could equate to anything from 400 kilocalories to 800 kilocalories lost depending on a person s height and weight alone the study said Dr David Ellis lecturer in computation social science at Lancaster University said working out the number of calories burnt was a tricky business and relied on many different factors such as height weight percentage of body fat heart rate and more However because manufactures do not share the algorithms which are constantly updated used to determine calories burned it is almost impossible to know the exact source of error at this stage he said Fitness trackers can have a very positive effect on people s activity levels so complete 100 accuracy may not be vital if the devices are encouraging more exercise But recent trials have suggested that wearing them doesn t always result in a positive outcome or improve the chances of losing weight The researchers urged companies to be more transparent and publish the results of their own accuracy tests They said this would ensure the public and clinicians were aware of the devices limitations The Stanford team has set up their own website to share this kind of data with others", "Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn

DeepMind over sharing patient data In a letter dated February and leaked to Sky News Dame Fiona Caldicott throws doubt on the legality of sharing 1 6 million patient records Patients should have been informed about the deal she says Google said that the deal was covered by implied consent This rule exists to allow the NHS to share medical data with third parties for direct patient care without informing patients about each deal In the case of the partnership with DeepMind data was collected from patients at the Royal Free Hospital Trust in London in order to test an app to help doctors and nurses identify those who might be at risk of acute kidney disease In her letter to Prof Stephen Powis medical director of the Royal Free Hospital in London Dame Fiona said We keenly appreciate the great benefits that new technologies such as Streams can offer to patients in terms of better safer more timely care But she added It is absolutely paramount that this is done in a transparent and secure manner which helps to build public trust otherwise the full benefits of such developments will not be realised and indeed harm may be done She questioned the use of implied consent as the legal basis for the transfer of identifiable patient records because the data was initially used just to test the app My considered opinion therefore remains that it would not have been within the reasonable expectation of patients that their records would have been shared for this purpose she says She has written to the Information Commissioner s Office ICO which is currently investigating the data sharing deal and is due to report its findings imminently In response to the leaked letter a Royal Free London representative said The Streams app was built in close collaboration with clinicians to help prevent unnecessary deaths by alerting them to patients in need in a matter of seconds It is now in use at the Royal Free and is helping clinicians provide better faster care to our patients Nurses report that it is saving them hours each day DeepMind said We re glad the NDG has said that further guidance would be useful to organisations which are undertaking work to test new technologies The data used to provide the app has always been strictly controlled by the Royal Free and has never been used for commercial purposes or combined with Google products services or ads and never will

it one of the most influential organisations in the world Share Lab wanted to look under the bonnet at the tech giant s algorithms and connections to better understand the social structure and power relations within the company A couple of years ago Vladan Joler and his brainy friends in Belgrade began investigating the inner workings of one of the world s most powerful corporations The team which includes experts in cyber forensic analysis and data visualisation had already looked into what he calls different forms of invisible infrastructures behind Serbia s internet service providers But Mr Joler and his friends now working under a project called Share Lab had their sights set on a bigger target If Facebook were a country it would be bigger than China says Mr Joler whose day job is as a professor at Serbia s Novi Sad University He reels off the familiar but still staggering numbers the barely teenage Silicon Valley firm stores some 300 petabytes of data boasts almost two billion users and raked in almost 28bn 22bn in revenues in 2016 alone And yet Mr Joler argues we know next to nothing about what goes on under the bonnet despite the fact that we as users are providing most of the fuel for free All of us when we are uploading something when we are tagging people when we are commenting we are basically working for Facebook he says The data our interactions provide feeds the complex algorithms that power the social media site where as Mr Joler puts it our behaviour is transformed into a product Trying to untangle that largely hidden process proved to be a mammoth task We tried to map all the inputs the fields in which we interact with Facebook and the outcome he says We mapped likes shares search update status adding photos friends names everything our devices are saying about us all the permissions we are giving to Facebook via apps such as phone status wifi connection and the ability to record audio All of this research provided only a fraction of the full picture So the team looked into Facebook s acquisitions and scoured its myriad patent filings The results were astonishing Visually arresting flow charts that take hours to absorb fully but which show how the data we give Facebook is used to calculate our ethnic affinity Facebook s term sexual orientation political affiliation social class travel schedule and much more One map shows how everything from the links we post on Facebook to the pages we like to our online behaviour in many other corners of cyber space that are owned or interact with the company Instagram WhatsApp or sites that merely use your Facebook log in could all be entering a giant algorithmic process And that process allows Facebook to target users with terrifying accuracy with the ability to determine whether they like Korean food the length of their commute to work or their baby s age Another map details the permissions many of us willingly give Facebook via its many smartphone apps including the ability to read all text messages download files without permission and access our precise location Individually these are powerful tools combined they amount to a data collection engine that Mr Joler argues is ripe for exploitation If you think just about cookies just about mobile phone permissions or just about the retention of metadata each of those things from the perspective of data analysis

the firm says it complies with privacy protection laws in all countries Thousands of new staff have been recruited to police its content Mr Joler though while admitting that his research made him a little paranoid about the information that was being harvested is more worried about the longer term The data will remain in the hands of one company Even if its current leaders are responsible and trustworthy what about those in charge in 20 years Analysts say Share Lab s work is valuable and impressive It s probably the most comprehensive work mapping Facebook that I ve ever seen says Dr Julia Powles an expert in technology law and policy at Cornell Tech The research shows in cold and calculated terms how much we are giving away for the value of being able to communicate with your mates she says The scale of Facebook s reach can be stated in raw numbers but Share Lab s maps make it visceral in a way that drawing parallels cannot We haven t really got appropriate historical analogies for the tech giants explains Dr Powles Their powers she continues extend far beyond the likes of the East India Company and monopolies of old such as Standard Oil And while many may consider the objectives of Mark Zuckerberg s empire to be rather benign its outcomes are not always so Facebook argues Dr Powles plays to our base psychological impulses by valuing popularity above all else Not that she expects Share Lab s research to lead to a mass Facebook exodus or a dramatic increase in the scrutiny of tech titans What is most striking is the sense of resignation the impotence of regulation the lack of options the public apathy says Dr Powles What an extraordinary situation for an entity that has power over information there is no greater power really It is this extraordinary dominance that the Share Lab team set out to illustrate But Mr Joler is quick to point out that even their grand maps cannot provide an accurate picture of the social media giant s capabilities There is no guarantee for example that there are not many other algorithms at work that are still heavily guarded trade secrets However Mr Joler argues it is still the one and only map that exists of one of

impossible to make accurate predictions based on information about just a few of the gene variants involved as many of these tests do That said some studies do suggest that this kind of analysis might

flood of automated comments to the Federal Communications Commission FCC was detected over the weekend More than 400 000 comments with remarkably similar wording have been detected in recent days Net neutrality proponents argue that all internet traffic should be equal This means that no content provider should be able to for example charge more for faster access to certain data One expert described bot activity as a new form of protest Someone has gone out of their way to make these seem like real submissions wrote Chris Sinchok in a blog post about the apparently automated activity Having downloaded the comments and associated data Mr Sinchok noticed that the names and email addresses associated with thousands of them also turned up in lists of personal data stolen from websites He told the BBC that this suggested someone might be using information collected from breached databases to make the submissions look more authentic It really seems like this is getting pooled from some place in an automated fashion and it s coming in at unreasonable rates he said He added that the uniformity of the data was also a possible giveaway For example many comments are essentially identical save for the occasional small difference such as the exact same sentence appearing in multiple comments but with different letters capitalised each time And the rate at which comments were posted also seemed suspicious starting and stopping in bursts he added Other watchers including a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT and another at Harvard University have also tracked a boom in apparently automated activity directed at the site in recent days Earlier this month the FCC said it had been targeted by a distributed denial of service DDoS attack that led to downtime for the comments system This followed a television appearance by comedian John Oliver in which he urged people to post comments against the proposals on the FCC s website Net neutrality is such a hot button issue and it s one of the few examples of online activism that s actually amounted to something noted Prof Phil Howard at the Oxford Internet Institute He cited the 2014 online protests after which President Obama stepped in to recommend that the FCC drop earlier proposals to curtail net neutrality This is how people protest these days said Prof Howard referring to the apparently automated comments He also pointed out that a growing number of people had the necessary programming skills to do it However Mr Sinchok is concerned that the bot activity will create the impression that genuine opposition to the FCC s current proposals does not really exist There are people that care about this issue a lot he told the BBC Activity like this is really muddying the waters and I don t want it to give the FCC an excuse to say Hey there s mixed support for this The FCC has not yet responded to a BBC request for comment", "Share this with Email Facebook Messenger

insignificant said Costin Raiu from Kaspersky Lab Windows 7 was first released in 2009 and the most widely infected version was the x64 edition which is widely used in large organisations showed figures from Kasperksy Many organisations seem to have been caught out because they failed to apply a patch issued by Microsoft in March that blocked the vulnerability which WannaCry exploited Spanish telecoms firm Telefonica French carmaker Renault German rail firm Deutsche Bahn logistics firm Fedex Russia s interior ministry and 61 NHS organisations were all caught out by WannaCry After

to the ransomware There have been no reports that anyone who paid has had their data restored by the gang behind the attack Security experts also found that the worm spread largely by seeking out vulnerable machines on the net by itself Before now many thought it had got started via an email based phishing campaign Adam McNeil a senior malware analyst at Malwarebytes said the worm was primed to look for machines vulnerable to a bug in a Microsoft technology known as the Server Message Block SMB The attackers initiated an operation to hunt down vulnerable public facing SMB ports and once located used the newly available SMB exploits to deploy malware and propagate to other vulnerable machines within connected networks he wrote Mr McNeil said he suspected that whoever was behind the worm first identifed a few thousand vulnerable machines which were used as the launch platform for the much larger waves of infection", "Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter

probe into the political use of private data has been opened by the information commissioner Elizabeth Denham announced the review amid concerns over allegations involving an analytics firm linked to a Brexit campaign It follows calls for an investigation into claims that Leave EU had not declared the role of Cambridge Analytica CA in its campaign The Electoral Commission says its powers do not extend beyond the UK But Ms Denham said Having considered the evidence we have already gathered I have decided to open a formal investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes This will involve deepening our current activity to explore practices deployed during the UK s EU referendum campaign but potentially also in other campaigns The probe was sparked by Labour s Stephen Kinnock a remain campaigner who called on the Electoral Commission to look into links between Leave EU and CA Claire Bassett the commission s chief executive said while it had very clear rules governing the permissibility of donations and printed materials such as campaign leaflets it has no power to stop overseas individuals or governments using social media to influence British elections At the moment the rules apply to print media so if you get a leaflet through your door that should have an imprint on it which makes it clear who s produced that leaflet and where it s come from so you know who s campaigning for your vote she said At the moment those rules don t extend to social media and we ve recommended that that should happen But quizzed about how far the electoral watchdog could go to prevent individuals or governments attempting to influence British elections via data analytic companies which target voters Ms Bassett said If something is happening outside of the borders of this country and is not part of any of the regime we re responsible for it s not something we can cover within our regulation Ms Denham said it was understandable that political campaigns are exploring the potential of advanced data analysis tools to help win votes but said the public have the right to expect that this takes place in accordance with the law This is a complex and rapidly evolving area of activity and the level of awareness among the public about how data analytics works and how their personal data is collected shared and used through such tools is low she said What is clear is that these tools have a significant potential impact on individuals privacy It is important that there is a greater and genuine transparency about the use of such techniques to ensure that people have control over their own data and the law is upheld Ms Denham said the investigation was a high priority for her team and that she was conscious that it coincides with the general election campaign The probe follows an Observer investigation suggesting there were links between data analytics firms a US billionaire and the Leave campaign in last year s EU referendum A Cambridge Analytica spokesman said the firm was happy to help the watchdog with any inquiry into the use of data analytics in politics but that it had had no involvement in the EU referendum The Electoral Commission found the Tories spent 1 2m on Facebook campaigns during the 2015 election more than seven times the 160 000 spent by Labour The Liberal Democrats spent just over 22 000 Leave campaigners spent 3 5m with a technology company called Aggregate IQ Vote Leave said it allowed them to target swing voters online much more effectively and efficiently But BBC media editor Amol Rajan said that while huge amounts of money were being spent by political parties online not everyone was transparent about their ambitions online We know that millions and millions of pounds have been spent by various people foreign forces sometimes extremists who are politically advertising online trying to influence elections and they are not regulated he said The fact is the technology is changing very fast but the law hasn t kept pace When it comes to broadcast advertising we tend to know who s advertising how much money they are spending and they tend to do it within certain social norms but when it comes to political advertising online it s very unclear who is spending the money and to what end The point is we simply don t have clear regulations that require people to be transparent The implication is that they might be foreign forces they might be very wealthy individuals who are having a material impact on elections in western or non Western democracies and we simply don t know

being dissected If George Foster executed in 1803 had woken up on the lab table it would have been in particularly undignified circumstances In front of an enthralled and slightly horrified London

which have helped create the economic world we live in It is broadcast on the BBC World Service You can find more information about the programme s sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast Foster s body was being galvanised a word coined for Luigi Galvani the Italian scientist s uncle In 1780s Italy Galvani had discovered that touching the severed legs of a dead frog with two different types of metal caused the legs to jerk Galvani thought he had discovered animal electricity and his nephew was carrying on the investigations Galvanism briefly fascinated the public inspiring Mary Shelley s novel Frankenstein Galvani was wrong There is no animal electricity You can t bring hanged bodies back to life and Victor Frankenstein s monster remains safely in the realms of fiction But Galvani was wrong in a useful way because he showed his experiments to his friend Alessandro Volta who had better intuition about what was going on The important thing Volta realised wasn t that the frog flesh was of animal origin It was that it contained fluids which conducted electricity allowing a charge to pass between the different types of metal When the two metals connected Galvani s scalpel touching the brass hook on which the legs were hung the circuit was complete and a chemical reaction caused electrons to flow Volta experimented with different combinations of metal and different substitutes for frogs legs In 1800 he showed that you could generate a constant steady current by piling up sheets of zinc copper and brine soaked cardboard Volta had invented the battery and gave us a new word volt His insight won him admirers Napoleon made him a count But it wasn t especially practical not at first The metals corroded the salt water spilled the current was short lived and it couldn t be recharged It was 1859 before we got the first rechargeable battery made from lead lead dioxide and sulphuric acid It was bulky heavy and acid sloshed out if you tipped it over But it was useful the same basic design still starts our cars The first dry cells the familiar modern battery came in 1886 The next big breakthrough took another century In 1985 Akira Yoshino patented the lithium ion battery later commercialised by Sony Lithium was popular with researchers as it s very light and highly reactive lithium ion batteries can pack lots of power into a small space Unfortunately lithium also has an alarming tendency to explode when exposed to air and water so it took some clever chemistry to make it acceptably stable Without the lithium ion battery mobiles would likely have been much slower to catch on Consider what cutting edge battery technology looked like in 1985 Motorola had just launched the world s first mobile phone the DynaTAC 8000x Known affectionately as the brick it weighed nearly 1kg Its talk time was 30 minutes Just google it How one company came to dominate search Tick tock The importance of knowing the right time How a razor revolutionised the way we pay for stuff Rise of the robots What advances mean for workers The technology behind lithium ion batteries has certainly improved 1990s laptops were clunky and discharged rapidly Today s sleek ultraportables will last for a long haul flight Still battery life has improved at a much slower rate than other laptop components such as memory and processing power Where s the battery that s light and cheap recharges in seconds and never deteriorates with repeated use We re still waiting But there is no shortage of researchers looking for the next breakthrough Some are developing flow batteries which work by pumping charged liquid electrolytes Some are experimenting with new materials to combine with lithium including sulphur and air Some are using nanotechnology in the wires of electrodes to make batteries last longer But history counsels caution game changers haven t come along often In the coming decades the truly revolutionary development in batteries may not be in the technology itself but in its uses We think of batteries as things that allow us to disconnect from the grid We may soon see them as the thing that makes the grid work better Gradually the cost of renewable energy is coming down But even cheap renewables pose a problem they don t generate power all the time You ll always have a glut of solar power on summer days and none on winter evenings When the sun isn t shining and the wind isn t blowing you need coal or gas or nuclear to keep the lights on so why not run them all the time A recent study of south eastern Arizona s grid weighed the costs of power cuts against the costs of CO2 emissions and concluded that solar should provide just 20 of power And Arizona is pretty sunny Grids need better ways of storing energy to better exploit renewable power One time honoured solution is pumping water uphill when you have spare energy and then when you need more letting it flow back down through a hydropower plant But that requires conveniently contoured terrain Could batteries be the solution Perhaps It depends partly on the extent to which regulators nudge the industry in that direction and on how quickly battery costs come down Elon Musk hopes they ll come down very quickly indeed The entrepreneur behind electric car maker Tesla is building a gigantic lithium ion battery factory in Nevada Musk claims it will be the second largest building in the world after the one where Boeing manufactures its 747s Tesla is betting that it can significantly wrestle down the costs of lithium ion production not through technological breakthroughs but through sheer economies of scale Tesla needs the batteries for its vehicles of course But it s also among the companies already offering battery packs to homes businesses and power grids If you have solar panels on your roof a battery in your house gives you the option of storing your surplus day time energy for night time use rather than selling it back to the grid We re still a long way from a world in which electricity grids and transport networks can operate entirely on renewables and batteries But in the race to limit climate change the world needs

The other study of the broader device market found only 17 of manufacturers had taken steps to secure gadgets The reports come soon after more than 60 health organisations in the UK fell victim to a cyber attack The report on pacemakers looked at a range of implantable devices from four manufacturers as well as the ecosystem of other equipment used to monitor and manage them Researcher Billy Rios and Dr Jonathan Butts from security company Whitescope said their study showed the serious challenges pacemaker manufacturers faced in trying to keep devices patched and free from bugs that attackers could exploit They found that few of the manufacturers encrypted or otherwise protected data on a device or when it was being transferred to monitoring systems Also none was protected with the most basic login name and password systems or checked that devices they were connecting to were authentic Often wrote Mr Rios the small size and low computing power of internal devices made it hard to apply security standards that helped keep other devices safe In a longer paper the pair said device makers had work to do more to protect against potential system compromises that may have implications to patient care Mr Rios said all the problems he and his co workers uncovered had been reported to the US Department of Homeland Security which oversees companies that make medical devices The separate study that quizzed manufacturers hospitals and health organisations about the equipment they used when treating patients found that 80 said devices were hard to secure Bugs in code lack of knowledge about how to write secure code and time pressures made many devices vulnerable to attack suggested the study Despite acknowledging these problems only 9 of device makers and 5 of health organisations tested equipment annually for potential security vulnerabilities it found A higher percentage of makers 17 took steps to secure the equipment they made The study found that 49 of manufacturers were not using advice from the US Food and Drug Administration about how to secure devices The security of medical devices is truly a life or death issue for both device manufacturers

satellites and other payloads The company plans to start frequent commercial launches later this year Poor weather conditions had pushed the launch into the fourth day of a 10 day window and the Electron finally cleared its pad at 16 20 local time 04 20 GMT The launch was conducted with no media or spectators permitted but the company released a video of the lift off on its Twitter page It

revolution of the Earth We ll be investigating why however reaching space in our first test puts us in an incredibly strong position to accelerate the commercial phase of our programme deliver our customers to orbit and make space open for business The test launch one of three planned did not carry a payload as such although it was packed with sensor equipment to help engineers understand how the flight performed Eventually Rocket Lab says it will be lofting payloads up to 150kg 331lbs into a 500km high orbits that go from pole to pole We re on the cusp of something quite exciting Innovative companies are packaging really capable technologies into very small low cost satellites Their data will drive myriad new services from helping city officials keep track of urban development to giving farmers information about the performance of their crops But if this new wave is to succeed it needs cheaper access to space At the moment the economics and flight schedules of these small satellites are still being defined by the availability and price of a ride on a big rocket Rocket Lab aims to change that And there are others such as Richard Branson s LauncherOne project Rocket Lab s second vehicle is already built and set to fly in the next couple of months Keep an eye on the end of the year too because this US NZ outfit even has a contract to send a small lander to the Moon Rocket Lab s founder and chief executive Peter Beck is from New Zealand and the firm has a New Zealand subsidiary The country has less air traffic compared to say the US so there is less need for flights to be rerouted every time a rocket is sent to space New Zealand is also positioned well to get satellites into a north to south orbit around Earth The trajectory takes the rocket out over open

are becoming more and more common the most famous example being Elon Musk and his SpaceX Falcon rockets But the SpaceX vehicles are huge and are aimed at following in the footsteps of Nasa missions delivering cargo to the international space station and eventually sending people to Mars Rocket Lab s goal is to launch what by comparison is a tiny rocket for a fraction of the price but with much more frequency The Electron is a mere 17m long and 1 2m in diameter Each launch only costs about 5m Rocket Lab wants to conduct 50 or more a year Just to put this all into perspective SpaceX s current

another 20GW is in the pipeline China is installing solar panels at a similar clip its capacity leapt to 77GW last year up from 43GW As recently as 2010 there was only 50GW of solar capacity installed in the entire world This installation of solar power is much higher than anyone could ve believed just a few years ago says Josefin Berg senior analyst for the IHS solar research group The cost of the technology has dropped much faster than anyone anticipated she says but the main decline has been in the technology advances Solar panels are just not that efficient A major problem is that about 35 of the sun s light is reflected off the panels rather than being absorbed and converted into electricity So could biomimicry copying structures already found in nature help the panels become more light absorbent One research team in Finland thinks so It has been studying leaf structures to find out how they do it Prof Marko Huttula and senior research fellow Wei Cao at the University of Oulu studied 32 different types of leaf structure to see which absorbed light the best Corn seems to be the winner for light absorption says Prof Huttula That kind of makes sense because it is very fast growing Using what they d learned the pair designed a polymer coating featuring patterns of what Dr Cao calls nanodots This polymer is then applied on top of silicon cells So far they have succeeded in reducing the percentage of light lost through reflection from 35 to 12 Decreasing wasted light this way increases solar panels energy output by up to 17 they claim Now they are working on scaling up the process with collaborators in China Even with costs of solar cells dropping there are pretty large leaps forward in efficiency needed before solar energy can broadly supplant fossil sources says Dr Ross Hatton an associate professor of physical chemistry at Warwick University Today s commercial solar cells convert only about 16 to 20 of the sun s energy into electricity Solar cells based on semiconductors with both organic and inorganic parts called perovskite solar cells might boost this up to around 30 if combined with conventional silicon technology Perovskites can also be made as flexible lightweight films meaning they are both cheap and easy to install in a wider variety of places But a downside is that they tend to disintegrate in humid conditions I would say that there would be a very significant cost advantage over silicon but it s also about the utility silicon can t be used on the tops of automobiles or on the cover of your laptop says Dr Hatton Also they could be fabricated using a roll to roll process it s how you print a newspaper and is a very well established technology he says Several university spin offs like Oxford PV and Eight19 in the Cambridge Science Park have said they aim to market perovskite solar cells this year Another problem with solar is that at a domestic level installing it is still a cumbersome process and many householders don t much like how the panels look This is why Tesla boss Elon Musk unveiled a new design for solar panels that resemble traditional roof tiles And Austrian start up Smartflower has designed a neat all in one solar unit that sits in your garden tracks the sun like a sunflower and folds itself up for protection at the end of the day or in poor weather The Smartflower which costs from 13 560 17 660 produces enough electricity to power a standard household of four people but needs five cubic metres of space So the company is developing a smaller version for people with less external space They have sold the device in Europe since 2014 and last year in the US as well The firm is also developing an internet of things capability for the product so that the Smartflower can switch household appliances on and off depending on how much solar electricity is available With the cost of solar continuing to drop around the world and efficiency improvements however modest coming through the future of this renewable tech looks bright", "Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window We re losing the battle against fraudsters who are stealing or guessing our usernames and passwords with increasing success So could analysing the quirky ways we use our devices even the way we walk provide an additional line of defence These days you can t walk down a busy street without bumping into smartphone zombies oblivious to the world around them But little do they know that the way they walk hold and interact with their mesmeric devices could be telling service providers exactly who they are This is the amazing new world of behavioural biometrics the latest front in the cyber security war By using the accelerometers and gyroscopes in your phone we can gauge your wrist strength your gait and we can tell you apart from most other people with a one in 20 000 accuracy roughly equivalent to the accuracy of a fingerprint says Zia Hayat chief executive of Callsign a behavioural biometrics firm So even if a fraudster has stolen your bank log in details or downloaded malware onto your phone such behavioural software should be able to spot that it s not really you trying to make that money transfer to a foreign bank These behavioural idiosyncrasies are as unique as our voices tech firms say This is why Morse code operators could be identified simply by the individual way they tapped out messages Eyal Goldwerger chief executive of BioCatch another behavioural biometrics company says Authentication is all well and good but if fraudsters are already inside your system it s no use Most instances of banking fraud occur after user authentication has taken place The way humans interact with devices is very different to the way malware operates so even if your phone is infected lying in wait for you to log in before hi jacking your secure transaction behavioural biometrics should be able to spot the difference If the phone isn t moving but is being operated you might assume malware is working it says Mr Hayat We can even measure air pressure using the barometer on the latest smartphones which can give us another indication of where the phone is and whether that corresponds to where the user says he is Even the size of your fingers how much surface is covered when you tap on the screen can help build up a pretty accurate signature profile he says Perhaps understandably it is banks who are most interested in this new extra layer of security Callsign lists Lloyds Banking Group and Deutsche Bank among its customers Such behavioural specialists including firms such as Behaviosec NuData Security and Zighra are also partnering with cyber security companies that specialise in managing identities Callsign s technology integrates with ForgeRock s ID management platform for example We re moving to a password less world says ForgeRock chief executive Mike Ellis So these days we need multiple layers of authentication and behavioural biometrics is one of those layers Identifying the device its geo location and typical behaviour is another layer More banks are rolling out voice authentication as a more secure and less intrusive way for customers to establish their identity With the help of neural networks and machine learning authentication accuracy has risen from 98 to 99 says Brett Beranek director of product strategy at Nuance a voice biometrics specialist But even he acknowledges the need for another layer of post authentication behavioural security to protect users against malware infected phones As well as physical behaviours such as the speed with which we type and swipe there are psychological ones too says Mr Goldwerger the choices we make unconsciously when navigating a web page for example The way you decide to scroll down a page using the mouse scroll wheel or clicking on the webpage sidebar and dragging can be indicative that this is you accessing the website and not somebody else he says BioCatch says it measures more than 500 parameters when a user interacts with a digital device Using machine learning techniques the company says it can build a unique profile of a user s behavioural idiosyncrasies after just 10 minutes of interaction But behavioural biometrics are not intended to replace existing biometric authentication methods such as voice fingerprint or selfie but to complement them says Mr Goldwerger The advantage of this type of security is that everything we do is seamless and frictionless it all happens in the background without the user knowing he says The software can spot suspicious activity about 98 of the time he adds But what about privacy If companies like this can know who I am simply by monitoring my online behaviour is anonymity a thing of the past Could what started out as a way to find terrorists hiding behind encrypted communications become a way to identify us all whether we like it or not Mr Goldwerger insists that BioCatch technology does not see any user s personally identifiable information and the client usually a bank doesn t get to see the anonymised behaviour profile BioCatch produces All the bank sees is a risk score for that user session and all we see is an ID number associated with that person he says Callsign s Zia Hayat says his company does the same thing principally to comply with existing data protection legislation But what if a fraudster steals someone else s identity and sets up a new account from scratch Behavioural biometrics won t be any use surely if there s no previous user behaviour to compare it with BioCatch which has partnered with credit reference agency Experian thinks that even in this situation behavioural analysis can help Fraudsters will be less familiar and fluent with the data they re asked to produce because it s not theirs says Mr Goldwerger We can spot that and we can notice the different way they fill in application forms because they do it so often", "Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy

to become a technology hub on a par with Silicon Valley in California where the likes of Apple Facebook and Google are based I think Silicon Valley has infrastructures to support start up companies ranging from technological support through to funding he said And there is the sense that failure isn t irreversible so very often people will work on an idea and there isn t the same sense of stigma

Checkpoint said it had reported the bugs it found to media player makers The researchers found the bugs by analysing how the VLC Kodi Popcorn Time and Strem io media players handle subtitle files All four programs have been downloaded hundreds of millions of times suggesting a large number of people are vulnerable they said Attackers who exploited the vulnerabilities found in the subtitling

a blog detailing the findings the security firm said it was one of the most widespread easily accessed and zero resistance vulnerability sic reported in recent years Typically media players are programmed to automatically look online for files that can provide subtitles The players expect subtitle files to contain text only so most do not look to see if anything malicious has been inserted instead said the security firm In addition the recommendation systems of the subtitle file stores could be manipulated allowing attackers to ensure booby trapped versions would be picked ahead of legitimate files Checkpoint said The security problems are exacerbated by the large number of formats more than 25 in total used to prepare subtitle files The media players tested by Checkpoint used many different methods of reading data from these formats leaving them open to many different sorts of vulnerabilities While the weakness doesn t appear to have been exploited in real world attacks

must do more to find a real solution to problematic content online And Labour s digital economy spokeswoman Louise Haigh said The Home Office were crystal clear they did not want to legislate and that they believed the voluntary framework was sufficient The fact is that in government the Tories have been too afraid to stand up to the social media giants and keep the public safe from illegal and

would not replace humans We are not going to replace our police officers with this tool said Brig Khalid Al Razooqi director general of smart services at Dubai Police But with the number of people in Dubai increasing we want to relocate police officers so they work in the right areas and can concentrate on providing a safe city Most people visit police stations or customer service but with this

Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window It s still unclear who hacked incoming French President Emmanuel Macron s emails But what does the way they then spread across the internet tell us about the way hackers and political movements work in tandem It was a huge story that broke in the very final hours of coverage of France s presidential election campaign But whoever dumped the leaked Macron emails online did not by themselves turn them into a global topic of discussion That job was left to a network of political activists aided by bots and automated accounts and then ultimately signal boosted by the Twitter account of WikiLeaks BBC Trending has spoken to the main activist who took the data dump from a fringe message board to the mainstream and we ve pieced together the story of how the hack came to light Just before 19 00 BST on Friday 5 May a huge trove of files appeared on the anonymous document sharing site Pastebin under the title EMLEAKS They had first been posted on various threads on an online library site called archive org However as these threads have since been deleted it s not possible to gauge what time this first happened The timing is crucial It was just hours before the start of the pre election news blackout within France and so media outlets acted with extreme caution However a network of online actors moved quickly to spread the leaks Those who monitor internet politics know all about pol It s the anarchic political discussion forum on the anonymous messaging board 4chan and although frequented by video gamers and internet culture obsessives it s also a favoured hangout for a number of political activists associated with extreme right wing groups By 19 35 on 5 May a link to the Pastebin files appeared on pol The only detail about the identity of posters on the forum is a flag signifying the country of their computer s registered IP address However these are easy to fake The pol forum is crucial to the story because rumours of a data dump seem to have been circulating there for several days previously On Wednesday 3 May two days before the email leaks a user on separate thread on the board posted a different set of documents ones which suggested Macron had a secret bank account in the Cayman Islands There was vigorous debate on the board about whether the documents had been doctored Macron s political movement En Marche said they were fake and filed a lawsuit over the online rumours Those first documents were posted from a user who had a Latvian IP address But it s likely they were faking their location This user is probably not from Latvia and used a proxy to hide their identity from 4chan says Jules Darmanin a reporter at BuzzFeed News France That account is backed up by a later post by the user themselves who said I am not in Latvia The poster boasted of using proxy servers a mechanism by which users can mask or fake their location online Seven proxies is also a reference to an old 4chan joke about the ease of hiding online The user who dumped the Macron emails on Friday had a US flag included in their post on 4chan But of course they too could have been using a proxy The man who popularised the data dump says he was expecting it and was poised to spread it Fourteen minutes after the Friday leaks on 4chan at 19 49 BST Jack Posobiec a journalist who writes for far right Canadian outlet Rebel Media posted a link to the thread to Twitter using the hashtag MacronLeaks He told BBC Trending that the user with the Latvian IP address responsible for the first anti Macron leak had alerted him to the upcoming dump The same poster of the financial documents said to stay tuned tomorrow for a bigger story so I pretty much spent the next 24 hours hitting refresh on the site he told us How did Posobiec s tweet go viral so fast It was reportedly retweeted 87 times in the first five minutes suggesting says Ben Nimmo at the Atlantic Council s Digital Forensic Research Lab that the message was being boosted with the help of bots A bot is a Twitter profile which does not have a single human operator behind it Nimmo tells BBC Trending For its profile picture it will have an image of someone else or a random picture like a mountain or a bird it will be run by a computer programme by an algorithm which will essentially retweet everything from listed accounts or to retweet any tweets that mention certain words So it is fully automated BBC Trending documentary How The Great Meme War Moved To France Visit the Trending Facebook page There were some fully automated accounts spreading the tag but it wasn t just bots Thousands of real people shared the tweet too Several accounts that specialise in political messaging in this case linked to the US alt right movement shared Posobiec s tweet It s notable that this happened mostly outside of France Initially those sharing these messages were mostly English speakers rather than French speakers The biggest initial boost however came not with bots or alt right activists but in the form of the official WikiLeaks Twitter account which shared the 4chan link in a cautiously worded post The leaks then began being shared by well known National Front accounts this time in French Around 47 000 tweets were posted in three hours and the hashtag MacronLeaks began to trend in France By Saturday morning it had reached the worldwide trend list Crucially this meant the story was spreading despite reporting restrictions in force in France By this time an informal and global network of political activists was working hard to spread the story Conversations in private English speaking pro Le Pen groups on the messaging app Discord were discussing how to amplify Posobiec s hashtag and use internet friendly memes to further discredit Macron As the reporting restrictions approached and the hashtag reached full volume politicians from both camps scrambled to respond Florian Philippot the vice president of Marine Le Pen s National Front responded to the story at 22 40 BST 23 40 French time by tweeting Will MacronLeaks teach us something that investigative journalism has deliberately killed Sylvain Fort a campaign spokesman for Emmanuel Macron responded by calling Philippot s tweet vile Five minutes before the restrictions were due to start Macron s team released a press release condemning the leak saying that they had been subject to a massive and coordinated piracy action 4chan s owner Hiroyuki Nisimura tweeted attempting to distance his site from the leaks It still remains unclear who is behind the leaks But the Macron campaign said that some of the sites spreading the leaks were linked to Russian interests Similar allegations have been made in the past In March 2017 David Grout from cybersecurity firm FireEye told BBC Trending that there appeared to be interest from Russian hacking group APT 28 also known as Fancy Bear in influencing the French election After the latest leak a number of cybersecurity firms have also attributed it to the APT 28 group The group has previously been accused of attacks on the Democratic National Committee during the US election More from BBC Trending Conversations with hacker Guccifer 2 0 The Russian government has not commented on these allegations In the past it s denied political meddling of this sort saying they have never interfered with a foreign election The leak and similar online activity will continue to have political ramifications So far however it seems not to have

Commissioners at the agency voted two to one to end a net neutrality order enacted in 2015 Ajit Pai head of the FCC said the rules demanding an open internet harmed jobs and discouraged investment Many Americans and technology firms filed objections to the FCC s proposal prior to the vote This is the right way to go said Mr Pai ahead of the vote on Thursday In a statement the FCC said it expected its proposed changes to substantially benefit consumers and the marketplace It added that before the rules were changed in 2015 they helped to preserve a flourishing free and open internet for almost 20 years The vote by the FCC commissioners is the first stage in the process of dismantling the net neutrality regulations The agency is now inviting public comment on whether it should indeed dismantle the rules Americans have until mid August to share their views with the FCC This call for comments is likely to attract a huge number of responses Prior to the vote more than one million statements supporting net neutrality were filed on the FCC site Many people responded to a call from comedian and commentator John Oliver to make their feelings known Separately some protestors also used software bots to repeatedly file statements on the site Many fear that once the equal access rules go ISPs will start blocking and throttling some data while letting other packets travel on fast lanes because firms have paid more to reach customers quicker US ISPs such as Comcast Charter Communications and Altice NV have pledged in public statements to keep data flowing freely Despite this public pledge Comcast along with Verizon and AT T opposed the original 2015 rule change saying it dented their enthusiasm for improving US broadband Facebook and Google s parent company

Fight for the Future s complaint is signed by 14 people who say their details were used without permission to file anti net neutrality views The campaign group says that some of the comments were posted using the names and details of dead people The FCC has voted two to one to reverse net neutrality laws enacted in 2015 The vote was the first stage in the process of repealing the legislation designed to force internet service providers to treat all data traffic as equal Americans now have until the middle of August to comment on the proposals Almost 2 8 million comments have been filed on

erred on the side of openness But Fight for the Future claims that many of the suspected spam comments have been posted using genuine details that have been stolen In their letter to the FCC the group
