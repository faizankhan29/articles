significant volumes of renewable energy on the system he said We also have the tools available to ensure we can balance supply and demand Alongside the contribution from solar 23 of power came from nuclear sources 30 from natural gas and just 1 4 from coal Wind hydro power and biomass were also used A National Grid spokeswoman said the record level of solar power was achieved largely because of the clear and sunny weather on Friday She added that it would have been significantly harder to reach if it had been cloudy Britain has been getting more of its energy from renewable sources such as wind and solar as it seeks to meet European Union targets and phase out coal power plants However environmentalists have criticised the government s decision to cut subsidies to the solar power industry in 2015 Hannah Martin head of energy for Greenpeace in the UK said Today s new record is a reminder of what the UK could achieve if our government reversed its cuts to support for solar All around the world solar power keeps beating new records as costs come down and power generation goes up In April Britain went a full day without using coal to generate electricity for the first time

housing market appears to be moving sideways mortgage lenders have said as latest figures show a drop in borrowing The Council of Mortgage Lenders CML has reported a sizeable fall in demand for loans during April Mortgages worth 18 4bn were advanced during the month an 11 drop on the figure for March it said However monthly mortgage lending figures tend to be volatile and activity often drops in the spring Allowing for such a seasonal factor the CML said the amount borrowed last month was higher than the average over the past year and was 4 higher than in April 2016 The CML s senior economist Mohammad Jamei said The housing market appears to be for want of a better phrase moving sideways Nevertheless other factors are pointing to a slowdown in the housing market Earlier this week HM Revenue and Customs reported a 22 5 drop in property transactions in April compared to March One possible reason for the fall is that landlords might have brought forward purchases to avoid the latest in a series of tax changes From 1 April the amount of tax relief they could claim on mortgage payments was reduced The CML also said that the number of first time buyers taking out mortgages had overtaken the number of people moving house for the first time since 1996 Its research shows that while the number of home movers and landlords taking out mortgages is falling the number of first time buyers is rising First time buyers and remortgage customers appear to be buoying the market said Mohammad Jamei Home movers are having less luck Their activity has been subdued for some time now and the low number of movers means fewer properties for sale This supply and demand imbalance will continue to underpin house price values even as the rate of price rises slows", "Share this with Email

developments in Sri Lanka but many local citizens feel the country is being sold to the Chinese Normally the roads leading to Asian ports are bustling Trucks loaded with cargo Small shops where lorry drivers and workers take a tea break Hambantota port in southern Sri Lanka is starkly different Despite being open for seven years the access road looks barely touched And when we eventually found it signage is not its strong point and locals seemed pretty uncertain of its whereabouts too ours was the only vehicle Except for the few security staff accompanying us there was no one at the site A car carrier eased its way out of the port after dropping off vehicles from Asia s auto giants But the next ship wasn t due for two days And for a port that cost more than 1bn 770m that is just not enough business Hambantota was built by a Chinese company and funded by Chinese loans But now Sri Lanka is struggling to repay that money and so has signed an agreement to give a Chinese firm a stake in the port as a way of paying down some of that debt The terms of the deal are still being debated in Sri Lanka s parliament but the share it gives could be as high as 80 It is unaffordable for an activity that doesn t bring any economic returns says Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake So that s compelling us to look at options The vision for Hambantota was that it would bring more ships to Sri Lanka and ease pressure on the Colombo port one of Asia s most important container terminals Sri Lanka is located on the sea route that sees oil shipments travel from the Middle East making energy security a key reason China was keen to invest But it also fits neatly into China s controversial One Belt One Road initiative building road rail and sea links to boost trade with countries around the world Hambantota has struggled to make money partly because it is fairy isolated With no industrial hub nearby there are no natural customers on its doorstep But now that China looks set to take control of the port that is a problem it wants to fix and is talking to the government about plans to create a large economic zone buying 15 000 acres of land to build factories and offices But many who live in the area don t want to give up their homes and farms At a small village near the harbour locals are furious about the plan Many of them participated in a large protest against the investment hub in January Police used tear gas and water cannon to disperse people Some protesters were jailed for weeks which has only deepened the anger We wanted to show the world that we oppose this project says KP Indrani who was injured during the protest We are not against development but what they are doing is not going to be beneficial for us But these deals look like Sri Lanka s best way of paying down some of the 8bn it owes China The island s total debt stands at 64bn About 95 of all government revenues go towards debt repayment And when some of that money borrowed has been seemingly squandered on infrastructure that shows no sign of turning a profit that is even more damaging At the international airport barely 30km from Hambantota just five flights take off every week serving just a few hundred passengers Then there is a state of the art conference centre that is barely used and a cricket stadium now only occasionally rented out for weddings But not all of China s developments in Sri Lanka have proved a flop Roads and highways are being laid all over the country and some have really shortened travel time between towns and cities This has helped boost tourism the country s biggest source of foreign income In the near term there will be some local jobs for Sri Lankans says Angela Mancini who advises businesses and governments on investments But in the longer term I think the bigger upside potentially for Sri Lanka is to really get tapped into this global trade route system that the Chinese are backing Many of the China funded projects were planned and constructed during the tenure of previous President Mahinda Rajapaksa and are located in his electoral constituency A new government came to power in 2015 pledging to reduce Sri Lanka s reliance on China but financial pressures have forced it to tow the same line It initially suspended a major project that China had invested in a brand new city being built off the coast of Colombo on reclaimed land But the 1 4bn it was bringing in proved too hard to turn away and development resumed last year So at Colombo s historic Galle Face seaside promenade from where once you could only see waves and the horizon now there s a fresh piece of land jutting out into the Indian Ocean The hope is to transform it into a modern city by 2040 with swanky corporate buildings shiny apartment blocks hotels resorts beaches malls and even a marina The first part of it will be available for use in two years China Harbour Engineering Company CHEC which is building the city will get about two thirds of the marketable land on lease for 99 years in return for its investment What this project will bring to Sri Lanka is foreign direct investments estimated at 15bn says Thulci Aluwihare of CHEC Port City Colombo Last year foreign direct investment in the country was a mere 300m So this would be a catalyst for Sri Lanka Once again the government has faced opposition Groups of fishermen and locals have held protests and demonstrations Some are worried about the environmental impact of the project They are not convinced by the studies done by government agencies who have given it the all clear But many are also concerned about the growing Chinese influence in the country We don t like our land being given away to China says fisherman Aruna Roshantha Not just China if any country comes and takes land from Sri Lanka we don t like it The government should protect our land not sell it At the moment though Sri Lanka s government doesn t have much room to negotiate And Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake says they need to welcome everyone with open arms We love the Indians to come in we love the Chinese to come in we love the Japanese to come in Koreans or European we have no problem at all We need to basically sell ourselves and sell on a consistent coherent basis and make that economic diplomacy a selling tool for Sri Lanka", "Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger

think tank has warned The Institute for Fiscal Studies said the Tories had very few tax or spending commitments in their manifesto Labour in contrast was proposing very big increases in tax and spending However the IFS said Labour s plans for paying for its proposed expansion in state activity would not work IFS deputy director Carl Emmerson said neither manifesto gave voters an honest set of choices or addressed the long term challenges the UK faced For Labour we can have pretty much everything free higher education free childcare more spending on pay health infrastructure And the pretence is that can all be funded by faceless corporations and the rich he said There is a choice we can make as a country to have a bigger state that would not make us unusual in international terms But that comes at a cost in higher taxes which would inevitably need to be borne by large numbers of us Meanwhile the Conservatives offered spending cuts the party had already promised Mr Emmerson said Additional funding pledges for the NHS and schools are just confirming that spending would rise in a way broadly consistent with the March Budget he told a briefing in London on Friday Compared with Labour they are offering a relatively smaller state and consequently lower taxes With that offer come unacknowledged risks to the quality of public services and tough choices over spending The IFS said the Tory plans imply at least another five years of austerity with the continuation of planned welfare cuts and serious pressures on the public services including on the NHS Labour s calculations that 49bn a year could be raised from the wealthiest individuals and companies were flawed and would raise 40bn at most in the short term and less in the long term it said The Conservatives plan to impose what the IFS called very big cuts to working age welfare benefits would save 11bn annually by 2021 22 but would significantly cut the incomes of the poorest working age households Labour s manifesto in fact commits it to cancelling only a small minority of these cuts changing this would require finding several billion pounds extra from somewhere the IFS said The Conservative commitments to replace the triple lock on the state pension with a double lock from April 2020 and means test winter fuel allowance payments represent a very modest change according to the think tank However Labour s proposal to maintain the triple lock and to start paying state pensions no later than the age of 66 would be immensely expensive in the long run up to 50bn a year in 50 years time compared with raising the state pension age in line with life expectancy and increasing the pension in line with earnings John McDonnell the shadow chancellor said the IFS had underestimated the revenue raising effectiveness of some of Labour s proposed tax changes but added We recognise the potential for uncertainty which is why we have allowed headroom in our plans He added that the IFS s assessment of the Conservatives plans indicated they would damage the economy and public services with five more years of damaging austerity David Gauke the Conservative Chief

online start ups are emerging But the problems many of the companies hope to address are also a reminder of how far the island has to go Bernardo Romero Gonzalez a 33 year old software engineer from Cuba launched his new business this month a website where people can order island made products such as soap bouquets of flowers and cakes for home delivery It s like Amazon for Cuba but with a difference he told an audience of New York techies at a conference this month The summary was a classic start up pitch but it also underscored the obstacles when it comes to starting an online business in the Caribbean country Mr Gonzalez is counting on buyers from the Cuban diaspora which already plays a role in the economy sending money and other products to the island But the infrastructure doesn t exist for domestic buyers to sustain the market Internet access among Cuba s 11 2 million people is growing Between 2013 and 2015 the share of the Cuban population using the internet jumped from about a quarter to more than 35 according to estimates from the International Telecommunications Union The growing market has helped draw the attention of internet giants such as Airbnb Netflix and Google which installed servers on the island and started hosting data there last month The rise is also fuelling activity among local entrepreneurs who are launching domestic versions of sites such as the crowd review business directory Yelp But there s a long way to go Less than 6 of Cuban households had internet access at home in 2015 one of the lowest rates in the western hemisphere according to the ITU In the UK that figure tops 91 Wi fi hotspots in parks and other public places operated by the state run telecom company remain the primary way to log on Service at the hotspots is often slow expensive and selective with the government restricting access to the full range of internet sites The constraints are shaping the emerging Cuban start ups At this month s TechCrunch conference in New York Mr Gonzalez shared a stage with Kewelta a firm focusing on advertising within decentralised online and offline networks and Knales which provides updates on weather news and other events via text messages and phone calls Knales co founder Diana Elianne Benitez Perera told the audience that Cubans are disrupters by definition We always find the way to have first world conditions with third world conditions The government in recent years has taken some steps to boost internet access increasing wi fi hotspots in parks and other places lowering prices and experimenting with home installations The measures come amid broader economic changes in Cuba after the Castro regime loosened rules for private enterprise and the Obama administration eased the US embargo unleashing large numbers of US travellers The Cuba Emprende Foundation started working with the Catholic Church in Cuba about five years ago as the reforms started funding four week courses in entrepreneurship from which more than 3 000 people have graduated The Foundation helped organise the 10x10KCuba start up competition in which both Diana and Bernardo participated last year that led to the invitation to the Tech Crunch conference in New York in May There s change in the air says Anna Maria Alejo one of the people who helped organise the TechCrunch panel and helped raise about 10 000 7 700 to pay for eight entrepreneurs to attend the conference We re not exactly sure where things will go but there s a lot of optimism among these young people she says Cuba has a relatively high number of well trained software engineers especially for a country with its size and degree of internet access said Kirk Laughlin managing director of NearShore Americas The media advisory company published a report in 2015 that highlighted the island s potential as a hub for cheap IT labour But Mr Laughlin says he s been disappointed by how slowly the Cuban government has moved to improve the broadband network especially given interest from international companies and numbers of educated Cubans opting to leave and take their chances elsewhere There is such an opportunity to leapfrog ahead and really light up the island with really robust broadband That is just not happening he says When it comes to online start ups there s a lot of workarounds That s great that people have the ingenuity and creativity and in some ways we should applaud that he says But it s still a long way to go to get into the league that Cuba has great qualifications to participate in Some say the changes could accelerate after Raul Castro retires next year In speeches Mr Castro s presumed successor vice president Miguel Diaz Canel has indicated a more open attitude said Larry Press a professor emeritus at California State University Dominguez Hills who has researched the internet in the developing world and writes a blog on Cuba Mr Press said media recently praised Revolico a Craigslist like site that was blocked by the government after its launch in 2007 More recently it has been celebrated and has inspired competitors But those steps aside a lot of work remains he says Those indicate a change of attitude not a giant change of reality Mr Gonzalez who has also started computer repair and web development businesses said he thinks the moment for Cubazon is now while shipping to Cuba from the US remains limited He and the staff from his current business are working to sign up more businesses to sell their wares on Cubazon Many of the people he s talking to don t have an

equal societies but when it comes to female representation in business campaigners question whether the Nordic nation is right to keep basking in the spotlight as progress slows down back home Amanda Lundeteg already a chief executive aged just 32 is in one way a poster girl for gender equality in the Swedish workplace She holds a degree in Business Economics started her career in banking and has already served on three different boards Yet the sole reason Allbright the non profit company she manages exists is to expose the limitations in career opportunities for women in Sweden Despite giving fathers the right to take paid time off since the 1970s and one of the world s most generous parental leave packages currently 480 tax funded days to share between a couple and heavily subsidized day care capped at some 1 230 Swedish krona 141 108 a month Ms Lundeteg argues Sweden is less progressive than many might think We re really good at bragging about how good we are but if you ask most women in Sweden I definitely don t think that they are satisfied On the plus side more than 80 of mothers work and Sweden leads the industrialised world in terms of public sector gender equality according to the OECD but Allbright s research shows the private sector and the rapidly growing startup scene is struggling to keep up In 2016 more than 80 of managers at listed Swedish companies were men and not a single new business on the stock market had a woman boss The main reason for this imbalance is that traditional gender stereotypes prevail despite decades of legislation designed to even things out says Ms Lundeteg It s possible to live a gender equal life in Sweden but we don t do it because of traditions As a man you re supposed to be the one who works and brings home the meat to the cave It s about stereotypes and privileges that will take time to break down Figures from Statistics Sweden confirm that women still take more than 80 of a couple s parental leave while their first child is under the age of two Women also remain much more likely to work part time than men When it comes to equal pay for similar work Sweden is close to the OECD average and drops to 35th place on the World Economic Forum s gender equality ranking It isn t difficult to find Swedes who are willing to talk about the discrepancies There s still a lot of fathers who don t take their parental leave so it s not perfect yet says Martin Hector 32 as he takes his baby son for a stroll in Ralambshovs park in central Stockholm Over the summer for three months or something like that feels the most common He s planning to take a total of nine months off work Camilla Dath a lawyer who is also braving unusually chilly May temperatures of 2C with her seven month old is taking 11 months leave and says her husband will take a similar period off work But other parents might not have the same opportunities she argues if one partner earns substantially more than the other or because they work in organisations with more old fashioned cultures I have friends working in big law firms and they have a harder time to take parental leave she says When it comes to the number of women in management the biggest discrepancies are still in the traditionally male industries of manufacturing and technology However Allbright s research suggests that financial services and property companies have made significant improvements in recent years Rental accommodation firm Heba for example recently climbed 100 places in Allbright s rankings after replacing several of its top male executives resulting in a female majority in management However its chief executive Lennart Karlsson is candid enough to admit that reaching gender equality was not his original goal I thought competence was the main thing competence and attitude not sex but I ve changed my mind The workplace works better because of the gender mix he says The discussion climate is better you have a better conversation and a better understanding for each other Amanda Lundetag argues this should boost his business too citing several recent studies including a high profile report for the Peterson Institute for International Economics which concluded that there is a positive correlation between the presence of women in leadership roles and an organisation s performance It s a link that is definitely not lost on the Swedish politicians spearheading what they ve described as the first feminist government in the world The Nordic nation s Left Green coalition pushed through a new law in 2015 aimed to encourage men to take a greater share of the parental leave Ninety days are now reserved for fathers on a use it or lose it basis What we want to see is an equal participation from the parents in the long run but we also have to take it slowly so that families will be able to adapt to the changes says Annika Strandhall Sweden s Minister for Social Security Next year will even see the launch of a new Gender Equality Authority an admission according to Ms Strandhall that Sweden s world famous feminist initiatives have not been as joined up as they might have been Yet while creating equal opportunities for men and women appears largely hard wired into the national psyche Sweden is split on the extent to which the state should intervene to pick up the pace The government s attempt to introduce legislation that would fine listed companies which fail to appoint women to at least 40 of board seats was rejected by parliament in January The fear of potential penalties seems to have acted as a catalyst though 33 of those put forward for board seats so far in 2017 are women up 2 on last year says Allbright putting Sweden behind only Norway and France both of which have legally binding quotas However the nationalist Sweden Democrats currently the second most popular party in the polls and the smaller centre right Christian Democrats voted against the 90 day parental leave quota for fathers They want families to have a greater choice when it comes to organising parenting There is a societal pressure because everyone goes back to work I felt I would be going against the norm if I had stayed at home explains Simone French a 46 year old who is originally from Australia She says she would have welcomed the opportunity to stay at home until her son started school Instead she ended up taking just a year off from her digital marketing career amid pressure from her employer and relatives It was my maternal instinct to be with my son every fibre in my being fought against going back It s not really talked about here but I have actually met a couple of Swedish women who felt the same However those cheerleading Sweden s march towards a completely gender equal society argue that evening out parental responsibilities is as much about giving fathers the same chance to bond with their children while they are young as it is giving women greater opportunities to climb the ladder back in the workplace You become closer with the children a better connection says Andreas Lundvick 38 one of the other fathers back in Ralambshovs park He s taking time out from his job at a major Swedish bank to look after his six month old son while his wife is studying full time a move he believes will have no impact on his future career I feel lucky when you

the world that does not provide some type of national paid family leave plan to new parents only 8 other nations including Papua New Guinea Suriname and Tonga do not provide paid leave California New Jersey and Rhode Island have their own state run paid family leave systems and New York state and the District of Columbia have policies that haven t yet gone into effect but that leaves the vast majority of the country uncovered In his proposed 2018 budget Trump is bucking traditional party lines by proposing what would be the first federal family paid leave policy in US history It has been widely reported that came at the insistence of his daughter Ivanka who has made women who work a central part of her newly forming political identity This is the first time a major Republican politician has recognized the importance of offering paid leave to new parents That s a huge step writes Christopher Ruhm professor of public policy and economics at the University of Virginia in an email to BBC News It is also one of the few added benefits in a budget that is filled with billions of dollars in cuts to social services and programmes It kind of sticks out it s almost the only domestic initiative in the entire budget says Isabel Sawhill senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution and the former associate director of Office of Management and Budget for the Clinton administration Most of these social programmes are being slashed to the bone So as a standout piece of policy that in theory could find favour with both Republicans and Democrats what does Trump s plan do How would it work The plan would require that all new parents including adoptive parents receive six weeks of paid leave While it will be a nationwide requirement the benefits themselves would be administered by the states The proposal will allow States to establish paid parental leave programs in a way that is most appropriate for their workforce and economy the budget reads The proposal gives states broad latitude This means the Trump budget is very light on specifics You re seeing the skeleton you re not seeing what s inside how it will actually work says Aparna Mathur a resident scholar in economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute This is not much better than what they had on the campaign and they ve had months to think about this Payments to parents will come out of each state s Unemployment Insurance programme Theoretically a new parent would apply for the benefit the same way a newly laid off worker would apply for benefits The coffers of state Unemployment Insurance funds are filled by state and federal taxation on employers State control could also mean there would be significant variation in the exact amount of pay parents receive who would be eligible and how to apply the current budget proposal does not address any of these specifics Mathur points out that in order to qualify for unemployment benefits in New York a person must show she earned 1 900 in a calendar quarter But in California the minimum earnings amount to qualify for unemployment is 1 300 If those same kinds of standards are applied to paid leave eligibility that would mean all new parents can apply but not all will be approved This is not insuring uniform access to everybody across the US says Mathur while Ruhm notes that Some states are well equipped to do this but most are not How will it be funded The Trump budget says that the plan will cost 18 5bn over the course of 10 years The budget projects that 2 2bn would come from eliminating fraud in the system while another 4bn would come from initiatives to get people off of unemployment benefits faster Sawhill is sceptical of these figures We ve been trying to reduce improper payment for ever and ever If it were easy we would have done it by now she says We re going to help people find jobs more quickly Well fine but how The rest of the money about 13bn would come from states raising their payroll taxes on employers It s technically not the federal government raising taxes maybe that s easier to swallow says Marc Goldwein senior vice president for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget But many state s unemployment trusts are already quite beleaguered According to the US Department of Labor only 21 states currently maintain the minimal level of adequate solvency How does it compare to other countries plans Past congressional plans and the plan promoted from the Hillary Clinton campaign promised 12 weeks of paid leave but even that pales in comparison to other nations The International Labor Organization recommends at least 14 weeks Canada and Sweden provide at least 26 while countries like Japan provide a full year of paid leave though some experts like Sawhill say there s reason to believe that much leave can actually discourage women from re entering the workforce Is this plan better than nothing If states are able to implement some of this it s definitely better than not having anything says Mathur My worry is that states will view this as an unfunded mandate and will not opt in at all in which case no progress would have been made On the other hand Betsey Stevenson associate professor of public policy and economics at the University of Michigan believes that the current proposal is too flawed to be seen as a good first step If we ended up settling there I think it would be a mistake because it would be hard to get something new done once something has been implemented she says The future of the proposal is anything but certain it will have to find favour with Democrats who may wish to block any part of the Trump agenda and with Republicans who have long lobbied against anything that might be seen as a

losing it on a night out in central London last summer She cancelled the HSBC card the following morning but noticed further activity over the next two weeks She said I m quite fastidious at checking my statement and I saw loads of small transactions coming out from places like Tesco food and wine shops and weirdly a dog grooming parlour in North London Because the transactions were small from a

the desert To the residents of the small towns surrounding the site it s a constant reminder of a failed economic promise For Jose Puebla Ortiz who sold his plot of land to Ford it s still painful to think of the economic prosperity his family could have had Mr Puebla Ortiz used the proceeds from the sale to buy a truck He expected to work as a private contractor during the plant s construction but since the company cancelled its plans he has struggled to find regular high paying work When Ford arrived and we thought everything would be good there was investment and there was money he says Now that investment has dried up Ford decided to pull out and overnight they told us it s over we re not continuing we re leaving this is cancelled And well there was nothing we could do More stories

at the time Mark Fields said the decision related to the declining sales of small cars the company was intending to build at the new plant But he also admitted that Donald Trump s presidential victory and the improved business climate the company expected as a result was a factor During the campaign and since assuming the presidency Mr Trump has expressed his anger at car companies such as GM and Toyota for using Mexican plants to build cars sold in the US He has called for the North American Free Trade Agreement Nafta to be renegotiated blaming it for the loss of US jobs The agreement which came into effect between the US Canada and Mexico in 1994 created one of the world s largest free trade zones by reducing or eliminating tariffs on most products It is that kind of executive pressure that has residents here worried It s because of Donald Trump that the plant wasn t made here he said if he became president he d take it away He became president and he followed through says Fidel Ribera who had been working on the construction of the Ford plant For many in San Luis Potosi Mr Trump s presidency is seen as a real threat But most economists politicians and industry observers think his calls to pull out of or rework Nafta are all talk There s a learning curve says Eduardo Soliz Sanchez head of Mexico s car trade body AMIA He says the checks and balances in the US government where the different branches of government hold equal authority and offset one another and the interdependence of the car industry across the Nafta members will keep the deal alive Someone should explain to Mr Trump says Manuel Molano from the Mexican Competitiveness Institute Maybe you started with an oil molecule in Mexico That becomes some plastic part and goes up north to the US and becomes a more sophisticated part of a car Then the piece goes back south and becomes a motor and then goes back up and becomes a complete car On average car parts made in North America cross the US border to Mexico or Canada eight times And that could mean that restricting Nafta or imposing border taxes on car parts made in the US s neighbours could cost American jobs Mexican officials are betting the US won t shoot itself in the foot even as its new president tries to change his country s role in the global economy It s a bet they can t afford to lose The car sector makes up 6 of Mexico s gross domestic product and 25 of its exports In just over 20 years Mexico has gone from a relatively insular economy to the fourth largest car exporter behind Germany South Korea and Japan Economist Jonathan Heath says Nafta cemented the opening of Mexico s economy That is when the auto industry started to flourish Now almost every single carmaker in the world is present in Mexico Mr Heath says It is not just Nafta that has attracted companies such as BMW Nissan and General Motors Mexico has trade deals with 45 countries and its position on the US border with access to both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans makes it an ideal trading hub for carmakers But any changes to its deal with the US would still be a big blow Mexico exported 77 of the cars it made to the US last year Still AMIA head Mr Soliz Sanchez admits that after 23 years Nafta would benefit from being updated He says his group which represents Mexico s car and car parts makers would be okay with deepening and modernising the trade agreement But for Mexicans who have benefited from its influence changes to the deal pose a risk We have people from the community here working in BMW in General Motors says Mr Ortiz That s what we imagined with Ford that there d be a lot of work so there d be enough for all the boys But there s nothing we can do this was cancelled Ford was cancelled Mr Ortiz s village is thousands of miles from Washington DC but the decisions and the rhetoric coming from the US is having a direct impact on him and his neighbours While the car industry as a whole may not be turning its back on Mexico the uncertainty is casting a shadow over the livelihoods of Mexicans that rely on the sector", "Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window Politicians of all parties spend election campaigns fighting for the votes of what they call ordinary or hard working people There are record numbers of people in work in the UK but what exactly do they do and what might be on their minds when they head out to vote When politicians want to appeal to working people they tend to don hard hats and head to factories or construction sites These workplaces may look good in pictures but they do not chime with most people s experience of work Fewer than one in 10 people work in manufacturing and even fewer in construction In contrast four out of five people work in service industries This covers everything from bank workers to plumbers and restaurant staff the businesses that provide work for customers but which don t manufacture things These service sector jobs have grown over time 20 years ago they made up less than three quarters of employment The biggest growth since then has been in public administration education and health Over the same period the biggest fall has been in manufacturing where the share of jobs has halved since the 1990s The sector now provides employment for just under three million workers The world of work may once have been a man s world but that is no longer the case At the start of the 1970s a little over one third of workers were women But rapid growth in female employment during the 1970s and 1980s means that women now make up almost half of the workforce However there are still big challenges in terms of how men and women experience work like the enduring gender pay gap which is 18 for all workers and 9 among full time staff Nonetheless rising female employment has been one of the key drivers of improvements in living standards over the past 50 years More recently the workforce has also grown older Nearly one in three people in work is now aged 50 and over compared to just over one in five back in 1992 This trend is being driven by rising life expectancy the progress of the large baby boomer generation through their careers and policy changes like the increasing state pension age The changing nature of work and the jobs people do to make ends meet has become an increasingly important issue At present there is a particular focus on the emerging gig economy The term is often used to describe short term casual work although there is some disagreement about exactly what it means and the number of jobs it includes However what is clear is that ways of working that might be thought of as atypical have increased In the UK there are nearly five million self employed people from highly paid management consultants to delivery drivers an increase of 50 since the turn of the millennium In addition there are 900 000 workers on zero hours contracts and 800 000 agency workers Both groups have grown markedly in recent years Less clear is what is driving this and whether these jobs provide an acceptable balance between flexibility and security for workers As a result the government has commissioned a high profile review of employment practices in the modern economy which will report later this year Although the world of work is changing it is still the case that most people have what might be called traditional jobs Nearly two thirds of people in work have full time roles for an employer a proportion that has fallen only slightly since the early 1990s The average working week is 32 hours long only an hour shorter than it was a quarter of a century ago Even if we only focus on workers aged under 30 it remains the case that two thirds more than five million of them have full time employee jobs However this proportion has fallen a bit faster since the early 1990s But with 32 million people in work overall and the employment rate at a record high job numbers have never been stronger going into an election For most people living standards are determined by whether they have a job and how much they get paid For the lowest paid workers the introduction of the National Minimum Wage in 1999 set a minimum hourly rate for the first time It has since risen faster than both inflation and average earnings The bar was raised further with the introduction of the National Living Wage in April 2016 bringing a 70p hourly pay rise to millions of minimum wage workers aged 25 and over This meant that the earnings of the lowest paid are growing faster than average earnings a trend which is forecast to continue The wider picture for earnings is not so positive The UK experienced a pay squeeze following the financial crisis of 2008 with wages growing more slowly than prices for five years Helped by low inflation a couple of recovery years followed but real wages are once again falling as pay fails to keep up with inflation Combined with the Office for Budget Responsibility s gloomy economic forecasts for the coming years it looks likely that average real pay will be lower in the years 2011 to 2020 than it was between 2001 and 2010 That would make this the worst decade for earnings in over 200 years Average earnings are 480 per week but they would be closer to 600 per week if these two periods of pay squeeze had been avoided Improving productivity is going to be key for any government if it wants to deliver for the hard working people it champions Achieving that

football in 1960s America only for it to quickly end in tears When Geoff Hurst smashed his third goal into the roof of the West German net in 1966 he not only secured the World Cup for England he helped kick start a bold plan to introduce the round ball version of football to America The venture launched on this day 50 years ago but was facing an uncertain future just six weeks later The mid 1960s was the time of the so called British Invasion of the US when UK music fashion photography drama and other creative arts were in huge demand Stateside That movement coincided with the emergence of fledgling satellite TV technology which beamed the football World Cup in England to a captivated television audience on the other side of the Atlantic Their positive reaction to the football a sport most viewers actually knew little about prompted a group of US businessmen to get together to draw up plans to establish a professional football or soccer league in the country And in a strange quirk to the tale the UK also ended up providing a majority of the teams which were reborn with new exotic American names for the duration of the US season So Wolverhampton Wanderers became the LA Wolves Aberdeen the Washington Whips Hibs the Toronto City Sunderland the Vancouver Royal Canadians Stoke the Cleveland Stokers Dundee United the Dallas Tornado and Glentoran the Detroit Cougars Alan Rothenberg the man who would later bring the 1994 World Cup to the US was there on the inside when the plans were first hatched by that group of sports entrepreneurs The 1966 World Cup in England had been shown on satellite television in the United States and had been a big success he tells me I think it was the first time satellite had been used to broadcast sport to any great extent So a bunch of entrepreneurs said to themselves This is the next big sport There was no element of soccer evangelising These were hard nosed entrepreneurs they knew sports and they believed soccer was a great financial opportunity Back then Mr Rothenberg was a lawyer for sports entrepreneur Jack Kent Cooke owner of the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team and Los Angeles Kings ice hockey team Cooke was also building the Los Angeles Forum indoor arena and had an ownership interest in the Washington Redskins American Football team But as often happens with a new business idea two rival camps of sports entrepreneurs emerged It meant that a duelling politically combative pair of leagues came alive at the same time both seeking control of the marketplace and of the game They were the United Soccer Association USA headed by Cooke and his allies and sanctioned by the US soccer authorities and global governing body Fifa and the outlaw National Professional Soccer League NPSL The others did not get officially sanctioned but decided to go ahead anyway Mr Rothenberg recalls Also we as the official league did not get a TV deal but somehow the NPSL did with CBS To make matters worse the original plan of Cooke and his allies such as Lamar Hunt who went on to be an original founding investor in Major League Soccer in the 1990s had been to launch the United Soccer Association league in 1968 But the NPSL again outflanked its official rival and announced it would kick off its league in 1967 The USA league owners said Jeez we have got to do something So they turned to international transatlantic relations says Rothenberg They went to a whole lot of teams in England Scotland Ireland and elsewhere and brought them over to play in our league Each of the American soccer franchises which stretched from New York to San Francisco was allocated an imported club and each of the teams were given a new name and in some cases new playing kit The rebranded Aberdeen Stoke City and Wolverhampton Wanderers who represented Jack Cooke s own franchise the LA Wolves plus Bangu of Brazil kicked off the league on 27 May 1967 just before the famous Summer of Love A straight fee for agreeing to take part was paid by the league to each of the imported teams with each US franchise paying the club s expenses There were a number of reasons we turned to the UK for the bulk of the teams says Rothenberg Remember it was the World Cup in England that had fired the initial interest Also by winning the tournament England was the uppermost soccer power in the world In addition it was the close season in England and their FA was very co operative in helping us find teams to take part He adds It was also a time when British things were generally in vogue in the US and the nexus between America and the UK was stronger then And Cooke as a Canadian was very British in his outlook very UK focused in his Bond Street suits I walked into all of that as a 28 year old I was a vice president of the league and its general counsel and I also became more or less general manager of the LA Wolves team too In fact the LA Wolves went on to win the league beating the Washington Whips Aberdeen 6 5 in a thrilling final on 10 July 1967 It was an abbreviated season and crowd turnouts across the board were disappointing admits Rothenberg The fans who came along really got involved but most of them were not soccer converts unfortunately They were people from around the world who already knew the sport and were curious to see if our league would be a success For every gate in five figures there were downsides and indeed gates of over 10 000 were very rare When Northern Ireland s Glentoran Detroit hosted the Republic of Ireland s Shamrock Rovers Boston only 684 people turned up With hindsight the US just wasn t ready for two soccer leagues maybe not even for one in 1967 At the end of the season the two leagues merged as the NASL and Cooke got out after just one more season After the end of the first season it immediately became clear it had been a financial disaster for both leagues says Rothenberg All the owners who had invested money had been optimistic But it was a great unknown that they were taking on and ultimately they proved to be too early in trying to introduce soccer It was inevitable that soccer would eventually become part of the US sporting landscape with the big breakthrough of the 1994 USA World Cup But 1967 provided a kick start and soccer gained momentum in the 1970s with the NASL Pele the New York Cosmos and a great explosion in youth

world s most powerful corporations The team which includes experts in cyber forensic analysis and data visualisation had already looked into what he calls different forms of invisible infrastructures behind Serbia s internet service providers But Mr Joler and his friends now working under a project called Share Lab had their sights set on a bigger target If Facebook were a country it would be bigger than China says Mr Joler whose day job is as a professor at Serbia s Novi Sad University He reels off the familiar but still staggering numbers the barely teenage Silicon Valley firm stores some 300 petabytes of data boasts almost two billion users and raked in almost 28bn 22bn in revenues in 2016 alone And yet Mr Joler argues we know next to nothing about what goes on under the bonnet despite the fact that we as users are providing most of the fuel for free All of us when we are uploading something when we are tagging people when we are commenting we are basically working for Facebook he says The data our interactions provide feeds the complex algorithms that power the social media site where as Mr Joler puts it our behaviour is transformed into a product Trying to untangle that largely hidden process proved to be a mammoth task We tried to map all the inputs the fields in which we interact with Facebook and the outcome he says We mapped likes shares search update status adding photos friends names everything our devices are saying about us all the permissions we are giving to Facebook via apps such as phone status wifi connection and the ability to record audio All of this research provided only a fraction of the full picture So the team looked into Facebook s acquisitions and scoured its myriad patent filings The results were astonishing

willingly give Facebook via its many smartphone apps including the ability to read all text messages download files without permission and access our precise location Individually these are powerful

comprehensive work mapping Facebook that I ve ever seen says Dr Julia Powles an expert in technology law and policy at Cornell Tech The research shows in cold and calculated terms how much we are giving away for the value of being able to communicate with your mates she says The scale of Facebook s reach can be stated in raw numbers but Share Lab s maps make it visceral in a way that drawing parallels cannot We haven t really got appropriate historical analogies for the tech giants explains Dr Powles Their powers she continues extend far beyond the likes of the East India Company and monopolies of old such as Standard Oil And while many may consider the objectives of Mark Zuckerberg s empire to be rather benign its outcomes are not always so Facebook argues Dr Powles plays to our base psychological impulses by valuing popularity above all else Not that she expects Share Lab s research to lead to a mass Facebook exodus or a dramatic increase in the scrutiny of tech titans What is most striking is the sense of resignation the impotence of regulation the lack of options the public apathy says Dr Powles What an extraordinary situation for an entity that has power over information there is no greater power really It is this extraordinary dominance that the Share Lab team set out to illustrate But Mr Joler is quick to point out that even their grand maps cannot

currency as it gets put to new uses by developers and others looking to beef up cyber security Policy changes in Japan and elsewhere in Asia have made it easier to trade And of course when it comes to price interest generates its own momentum It s a promising technology says Joshua Rosenblatt 34 a Nashville based attorney at Frost Brown Todd a midwestern law firm with offices in eight states He is both an investor and works in the field The returns have been unreal and there s an aspect of not wanting to miss out on a bubble Bitcoin s market capitalisation shot past 30bn this month as the price climbed Ethereum remains smaller at about 15bn but it is growing too The price spiked from less than 20 in March to about 170 today according to CoinDesk which tracks the two currencies Activity is also up The number of daily trades in Bitcoin which is more established has rocketed from around 40 000 at the start of 2013 to more than 330 000 today About 2 700 participants attended an industry conference in New York this week according to Michael Crosby head of strategy for CoinDesk which hosted the event Mr Rosenblatt one of the people in attendance works with smaller investment firms and start ups navigating issues relating to coin offerings and smart contracts which use similar technology to enforce and verify business transactions In the last year the number of clients looking for that work has increased from one to about two dozen he says Our firm is kind of a middle America firm so the fact that we re seeing that sort of interest speaks to how much the industry has grown he says Grayscale launched its first digital currency investment trust in 2013 The New York firm now manages about 400m of investments in digital currencies up from 60m at the end of 2015 as its client base of wealthy investors hedge funds and other small firms has grown and prices for Ethereum and Bitcoin have climbed We ve seen just an absolute explosion says Matthew Beck an associate at the firm Bitcoin Is the crypto currency doomed I bought Bitcoins in 2011 now they re worth 19 000 Bitcoin value tops gold for first time Mr Beck says the firm expects to continue to attract interest as investors use digital assets to diversify We re seeing investors start to diversify and carve out an allocation for digital assets he says At the moment Bitcoin is used for cross border transfers payments for online activities such as gaming and gambling and as an investment says Peter Smith chief executive of Blockchain one of the major trading platforms The currency also made headlines as the preferred currency of the hackers behind the recent attack that crippled the National Health Service in the UK and other organisations around the world Industry members say some companies may be buying up Bitcoin to deploy in the event of a future attack but they maintained that broader demand is driving price gains There s a number of people from family offices and private equity firms they re making small bets and when you add that type of liquidity to the market that s going to drive the price up says Mr Crosby This year s Consensus conference drew some big corporate names such as insurer State Farm carmaker Toyota and consulting firm Deloitte Fidelity Investments a staid Boston based money manager known for handling retirement accounts was one of the presenters It now accepts Bitcoin in its cafeteria and will soon launch a feature to allow clients to check on their digital currency holdings alongside other investments In the scheme of global finance a 30bn market remains trivial says Blockchain s Peter Smith But interest from those players is a sign the industry is becoming more accepted It has truthfully gotten a lot more mainstream and that s a beautiful thing to see in many ways he says For 49 year old Stuart Fraser the climbing price has meant a tidy return on the roughly 15 000 worth of Bitcoin he bought in early 2014 He estimates his holdings have more than doubled even after subtracting the Bitcoin he used to buy a virtual reality headset and make investments in the newer Ethereum Investors say they are prepared for a boom bust cycle as the market continues to evolve technology changes and regulations come into play But Mr Fraser the managing director of Scotland based financial technology start up Wallet Services who previously worked in cyber security says unless he sees a promising new competitor he doesn t plan to cash in now I think in the long term it s going to go up", "Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter

the impact of a worldwide computer system crash BA says it aims to operate a full long haul schedule and a high proportion of short haul services after the outage caused by a power failure So far on Monday 13 short haul flights at Heathrow have been cancelled Cancellations and delays affected thousands of passengers at both Heathrow and Gatwick on Saturday All flights operated from Gatwick on Sunday but more than a third of services from Heathrow mostly to short haul destinations were cancelled In a statement BA said its IT systems were moving closer to full operational capacity and chief executive Alex Cruz has posted videos on Twitter apologising for what he called a horrible time for passengers But no one from the airline has been made available to explain the cause of the system crash and it has not explained why there was no back up system in place BA added At Heathrow we have operated virtually all our scheduled long haul flights though the knock on effects of Saturday s disruption resulted in a reduced short haul programme We apologise again to customers for the frustration and inconvenience they are experiencing and thank them for their continued patience One of the affected passengers is Ian Sanderson who is stuck in transit in London after setting off from his home in Luxembourg to travel to Iceland He said he was incandescent with rage after being unable to rebook his flight or speak to a member of staff Speaking on Sunday evening he said I ve bombarded them with about 100 tweets in the last 24 hours I know that s annoying but there s nothing else I can do We ve tried to call them on the numbers they give and all we ve got is the same recorded message which then cuts off at the end Former Virgin Airlines spokesman Paul Charles said What seems remarkable is there was no back up system kicking in within a few minutes system failing Businesses of this type need systems backing up all the time and this is what passengers expect BA is liable to reimburse thousands of passengers for refreshments and hotel expenses and travel industry commentators have suggested the cost to the company part of Europe s largest airline group IAG could run in to tens of millions of pounds Customers displaced by flight cancellations can claim up to 200 a day for a room based on two people sharing 50 for transport between the hotel and airport and 25 a day per adult for meals and refreshments On Saturday travellers spent the night sleeping on terminal floors at Heathrow on yoga mats provided by BA The disruption continued into Sunday with queues building up as passengers tried to rebook flights Conference rooms at the airport were opened to provide somewhere more comfortable for passengers to rest BA said Heathrow was still expected to be congested on Monday and urged travellers not to go to the airport unless they had a confirmed booking for a flight that was operating It said passengers could get a full refund or rebook to travel up to the end of November but recommend they use its website Thousands of bags remain at Heathrow Airport but BA has advised passengers not to return to collect them saying they will be couriered to customers The airline said there was no evidence the computer failure was the result of a cyber attack It denied claims by the GMB union that problem could be linked to the company outsourcing its IT work Gatwick Airport said it was continuing to advise customers travelling with British Airways to check the status of their flight with the airline before travelling to the airport Are you a BA passenger

cause was a power supply issue which our affected our IT systems we continue to investigate this The airline said it could not add anything further at this stage but it is understood that all systems are not fully up and running yet John Strickland air transport expert and director at JLS Consulting says The problem has affected multiple parts of the business which are not only customer facing but also operational facing and without which the airline could not do many tasks for example completing load sheets which are needed for fuel calculations for aircraft The GMB union has suggested the BA computer systems failure was another example of the shortcomings of BA IT systems since they made a number of staff redundant and outsourced their work to India in 2016 Mick Rix GMB national officer for aviation said BA made hundreds of dedicated and loyal IT staff redundant and outsourced the work to India BA have made substantial profits in for a number of years and many viewed the company s actions as just plain greedy And BBC transport correspondent Richard Westcott said Yes the union has a big axe to grind but still people will want to know if BA made its IT systems more vulnerable by scaling back computer support to save money Meanwhile aviation expert Mr Strickland added Surely a business should be able to make an outsourcing decision without any problems if it is done in a quality controlled way But this issue is part of the analysis that will have to be done by BA But the airline says We would never compromise the integrity and security of our IT systems IT services are now provided globally by a range of suppliers and this is very common practice across all industries and the UK government British Airways employs around 35 000 people in the UK providing high skilled and well paid jobs It hires 1 000 people a year and has a strong apprenticeship programme BA says Customers on flights that have been cancelled can claim a full refund or rebook to a future date for travel up until the end of November 2017 Customers are urged to keep any food transport or accommodation receipts and can make a claim in due course through our Customer Relations teams We are refunding or rebooking customers who suffered cancellations on to new services as quickly as possible and have also introduced more flexible rebooking policies for anyone due to travel on Sunday and Monday who no longer wishes to fly to from Heathrow or Gatwick We have provided customers with hotel accommodation The best channel for customers to use to get information about their flight is Manage My Booking on ba com This is now updated regularly We have also been using social media to communicate and airport communication channels Our CEO video which was posted on Twitter YouTube and Facebook has received more than 175 000 views We are extremely sorry for the disruption caused to customers and understand how much frustration this is causing Delayed travellers will also be able to claim financial compensation under EU law unless the disruption has been caused by factors outside the airline s control In 2014 two UK Supreme Court judgements stated airlines should have to pay out when a delay was caused by a technical fault BA says We have been doing everything possible to provide as much information to customers as possible but it has been challenging Many of the systems our staff usually use have not been functioning properly which has meant we were slower than usual to give customers accurate information at the airports In addition unfortunately the systems that we use to send emails and texts to individual customers about their flights have also been affected by the IT problems so we haven t been able to communicate with customers in our usual ways There had been complaints from passengers on Saturday that they had not been informed their flights were cancelled until after the airline had put out a media statement announcing the decision Passenger Terry Page 28 from London told the Press Association There s no such announcement here The boards are showing go to gate and no mention of cancellations Communications complaints continued at Heathrow on Sunday with one passenger telling the BBC they had no idea how much longer we ll be here and we re getting no communication from the staff Aviation expert John Strickland was at Heathrow on Saturday to collect a friend flying in from Mexico and says Communications have been a challenge There were BA people there on Saturday doing what they could but the tools usually at the disposal of staff were not available We are becoming more and more reliant on automation even in things like communications and less on actual people It means it is a challenge for businesses when things go wrong John Strickland says They will have to sit down in the cold light of day and analyse the causes and how to eliminate them in future There will need to be in depth planning in terms of managing any similar potential situation again BA is used to things like bad weather or air traffic control issues and other challenges but this is different By its very nature they did not have the information available that they would have liked to have had But he also added This could have happened to any other airline including a low cost one", "Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window There are plenty of things on a CV that can put off recruiters Having a gap on your work history shouldn t be one of them but the challenges faced by women returning to the workplace costs the UK an estimated 1 7bn a year in lost economic output So what can be done to address this black hole Julianne Miles co founded Women Returners to connect firms with candidates who want to get back into work but have a lengthy gap on their CV Like an internship a returnship is a placement at a company ranging from six weeks to six months Where it differs is that returners come in at a paid high level position following a minimum of two years out of the workplace Formerly a high level marketing executive for Diageo Julianne took a four year career break when her children were born before retraining as a psychologist Her initial goal for Women Returners was to counteract the negative stereotypes surrounding career breaks We were initially driven by the social goal of making sure a career break didn t mean career suicide I was aware that everything you read at the time was very negative that if you took a break you couldn t get back into a high level corporate role And you could see the reality of that on the ground it was very hard to get back in She points out that the career break penalty means it s not just the economy that is getting a raw deal Almost half a million professional women who are currently on care related career breaks are likely to come back to work in the future Of those three in five will move into a lower skilled or lower paid role than the job they had before reducing their earnings by up to a third according to PwC research last year A further 29 000 will be underemployed not working as many hours as they would like to If this penalty was addressed it would add an average of 4 000 on to the salary of each returner But Women Returners is not a charitable initiative Julianne estimates the hiring rate following each programme is 50 85 and points out the companies involved gain access to an untapped pool of talent What s more the multiplier effect of their combined 1 1bn in extra earnings and increased spending power would lead to a 1 7bn increase in UK economic output Yet only a tiny fraction of companies offer these schemes Tania Ash has just joined Enfield Council s six month returnship programme as a web architect After 20 years working in software development for private companies she took two years out to care for her father who had been diagnosed with dementia and look after her baby daughter I have a business background and when I decided to continue my career I was looking for an opportunity with flexible working hours she says It was really hard to find that in the IT industry because it s very rapid so this was a great opportunity for me to return to the industry And not all returners are sitting behind a desk Engineer Kate Young 37 took a seven year career break before starting her placement at Skanska last year when her younger child started school She has since become a senior engineer at the company The Skanska job was the first to hit all the boxes It was part time location wise it was flexible and it was relevant to my engineering skills she says I had heard some horror stories from people with big gaps in their CV where the initial recruitment filter just puts them straight in the bin But she says a returnship is good for both sides Going in for three months on a returnship means people do not expect you to immediately get there and they know you have your family life You know that if it s a disaster you can think well I ve tried it and it doesn t work right now so it takes the pressure off The Skanska returnship is open to both women and men who have had a career break Israil Bryan the firm s diversity and social programme manager says running a returnship programme has helped Skanska solve many problems There is a lack of diversity in the construction industry and there are skill gaps in some core technical areas like engineering and quantity surveying she says Within Skanska we sought to address both these things to bring quality people into our business but also people from other industries with core skills that could complement us There are many reasons why people find themselves taking a career break Natalie Lang 49 left her 20 year career in financial services to set up her own childcare business When she decided to return to the City recruiters were reluctant to take her on When I started looking for jobs and I was dealing with recruiters they were very reluctant to put my CV forward when there were other candidates already doing the job because they felt they had a better chance of getting the position she says But Natalie found financial services firm Fidelity s returner programme online and now has a permanent role at the company as a business risk manager While Julianne Miles s Women Returners project is still relatively small scale it is undeniably gaining momentum The number of programmes offered have grown from three in 2014 to 27 announced for 2017 so far In the March 2017 Budget the government allocated 5m for return to work schemes But what our society should aim for Julianne says is for returnships to become less significant as the attitude towards career breaks becomes more accepting It s not just about returners it s about opening the minds of companies to people who have had career breaks more broadly I would like to see returnships continue because it reduces risks on both sides but we are also bringing these role models into organisations There are only a tiny percentage of people in organisations that have taken career breaks so people can see them and think why are we prejudiced against people who have taken career breaks", "Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this

when I started reading it that I discovered he d been penning porn says Jamie 29 Bodice ripping sentences he stumbled over included the job interviewer had just asked her to remove her jacket and silk blouse and her black brassiere was working overtime Following the initial shock Jamie decided to read his dad s adult literature to some friends down the pub They immediately collapsed with laughter and piled in with their comments and critiques The evening was so much fun that it inspired London based Jamie to launch a podcast called My Dad Wrote A Porno Every week he and his friends James Cooper and Alice Levine discuss and analyse a different chapter of his father s unintentionally funny book which is called Belinda Blinked Since its launch in September 2015 the podcast has been a surprise hit surpassing 50 million downloads worldwide and regularly dominating Apple s iTunes podcast chart Listening to podcasts digital audio files that you stream or download to your mobile phone

autumn 2015 While for many people making their podcast is a happy hobby for an increasing number such as Jamie Morton it can be a very lucrative business So how can podcast makers make money With most podcasts being given away for free the answer is advertising revenues but if you aren t an expert on the advertising industry securing adverts may seem like an impossible challenge Help is at hand from the growing number of podcast platforms that connect podcasters with advertisers Podcast platforms that offer this service including Swedish start up firm Acast and the UK s Audioboom My Dad Wrote A Porno uses Acast and Jamie says Acast secures the advertising deals and then we record specific sponsorship reads that we slot into the show What Jamie means by reads is that he or one of his fellow hosts will read out a message from the sponsor of the episode or series He adds that they then try to make the sponsor relevant to the show It s a really great way of doing it because it makes them feel fully integrated into the podcast and we re able to put our personal spin on them and find editorially relevant ways of weaving sponsorship into the tone of our specific show While podcast expert Tom Webster of research group Edison agrees that the adverts work best when they feel like part of the content other commentators have questioned whether such an approach is being fair to the listeners These critics argue that there should always be a clear delineation between the content and the adverts so that the listener knows exactly what is commercially paid for More stories from the

exact figures for how much money its users make from advertising it says that its top podcasters can bring in tens of thousands of dollars a month from brands Acast s co founder Karl Rosander adds that podcasters can make a very good living if you have a popular show Meanwhile Mr Webster says that to earn serious money podcast creators need to be achieving more than 100 000 downloads a month In addition to a slice of the advertising revenues podcasters can also choose to put out premium content such as special edition episodes that people have to pay for Podcasting can also lead to other revenue streams Swedish podcaster Kristoffer Triumf founder of weekly entertainment industry podcast Varvet has been able to earn additional money from hosting live talk shows and has even released a

Edinburgh Fringe later this year and also embarking on a tour of Australia and New Zealand We sold out the Sydney Opera House in one day and added an extra night due to the demand which is incredibly exciting But while some podcasters sing the praises of the likes of Acast and Audioboom others deliberately avoid them London based Imriel Morgan and Efe Jerome run the Shout Out Network a podcast network dedicated to representing diversity Its five podcasts include Millennials of Colour which covers issues from mental health to poverty and are available via its own website or Apple s Podcast app Imriel says they prefer to work directly with advertisers so that they can have strict control over what adverts are connected to their podcasts something she claims isn t possible via Acast or Audioboom We have had a few meetings with Acast and Audioboom and have opted not to go with them says Imriel We think their method isn t suited to our audience They monetise content and place ads next to your content I don t want ads on the content that we haven t listened to before For example we are happy to advertise say cars and health products but with those platforms you don t know what that brand might be We are completely against that We have a lot of trust with our listeners For anyone wishing to start a podcast Jamie Morton says it is crucial to find an original angle if you want it to be a success It s such a saturated marketplace and because anyone can make a podcast there s a lot of competition he says He adds that making money should definitely not be your prime concern I

the pizza toppings Yosuke Masuko offers they d have to appreciate his obsession with quality control The 38 year old Japanese expat is the founder of one of the most popular pizza chains in Vietnam Pizza 4Ps With six busy restaurants in the country s three largest cities Ho Chi Minh City formerly Saigon Hanoi and Da Nang it serves more than 3 000 customers every day They flock to the outlets to try such pizza delights as salmon miso cream teriyaki chicken and ginger fried pork With more traditional pizzas also available such as margarita and Parma ham such is Mr Masuko s attention to detail that when the first restaurant opened in Ho Chi Minh City in 2011 he would refuse to accept payment for any pizzas that weren t perfectly round And importing key ingredients from Italy including the flour and tomato sauce he worried that the imported Italian mozzarella wasn t fresh enough because of the long cargo flight and the fact he could only get deliveries twice a week So Mr Masuko decided he would make his own As the cheese didn t exist in Vietnam he couldn t ask anyone locally for help so instead he learned to make it himself by studying YouTube videos Then unhappy with the quality of milk he was able to buy in Vietnam he bought a farm and his own cows Some might say this is a little too obsessive but Mr Masuko says he wouldn t have it any other way The mission of our restaurant is delivering wow sharing happiness he says To pursue our mission we keep in mind to always go beyond customer expectations While neither the Japanese nor the Vietnamese are renowned for their pizza eating Mr Masuko first started making them in 2004 when he installed a wood fired pizza oven in his garden in Tokyo The experience of making your own pizza with friends every weekend made me realise that I can make people happy by serving good food in a good space he says However it wasn t until seven years later that Mr Masuko decided to start making pizza for a living By that time he was living in Vietnam where he worked for a Japanese investment firm Fascinated by Vietnam s rising middle class he noticed that global pizza chains such as Pizza Hut and Domino s were opening up in the country and proving popular As Vietnam had been a former French colony the country was used to bread products particularly baguettes so pizza didn t prove too much of a jump for most people So with fond memories of his own pizza making exploits Mr Masuko quit his job and used his 100 000 77 000 savings to open the first branch of Pizza 4Ps in central Ho Chi Minh City The 4Ps part of the unusual name stands for peace He explains In the name 4Ps is our wish for inner peace and richness of hearts Looking back Mr Masuko says that quitting his investment job was not a decision he took lightly Everything was fine with my previous job back then he says The company even provided accommodation and my eldest daughter was three when we opened the first restaurant Of course I was afraid that the restaurant wasn t going to work but at the same time I felt like I needed to take the challenge Thankfully for Mr Masuko his restaurant was an immediate hit and the company has grown steadily ever since From 10 workers to begin with it now has 700 full time Vietnamese staff and 13 Japanese employees five of whom have management roles Mr Masuko says that when the first restaurant opened 90 of its customers were Japanese expats 5 Vietnamese and 5 other foreign nationals Today more than 70 of diners are Vietnamese In addition to making its own cheese Pizza 4Ps also arranges for Vietnamese farmers to grow it vegetables such as rocket and lettuces The company also sells some of its cheese to hotels and other restaurants Mr Masuko says In 2016 we had a turnover of 7 5m and in 2017 we expect 15m Ultimately the aim is to float the company on a stock exchange and open branches in other countries To help run the business Mr Masuko relies on his wife Sanae whom he met when they both worked for the same Japanese investment fund While Mr Masuko has the chief executive role Sanae looks after staffing matters and marketing Rather than pick Japanese or Vietnamese as the working language at Pizza 4Ps staff are instead encouraged to talk to each other in English Mr Masuko admits that this can occasionally cause communication problems but says that cultural differences can sometimes be the biggest problem Sanae explains We found the gap of working culture between Vietnamese and Japanese is the one that is difficult to bridge but things are improving Hang Do vice president of Seedcom a Vietnamese investment fund says she wasn t surprised that Pizza 4Ps has done so well For the past five years as the economy has grown the middle class has grown very fast as well and people have just been more open minded to the diversity of food and beverages she says Pizza 4Ps offers a very unique flavour Mr Masuko says he is confident that the Vietnamese pizza market will continue to grow and he is putting in the hours to ensure that Pizza 4Ps continues to be a success I go to the office at 9am and I do work 13 hours a day I am devoting my life to working", "Share

consequences Everyone agrees with that In fact that was the point Margaret Sanger the birth control activist who urged scientists to develop it wanted to liberate women sexually and socially to put them on a more equal footing with men But the pill wasn t just socially revolutionary It also sparked an economic revolution perhaps the most significant economic change of the late 20th Century 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions ideas and innovations which have helped create the economic world in which we live It is broadcast on the BBC World Service You can find more information about the programme s sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast To see why first consider what the pill offered to women For a start it worked unlike many of the other options Over the centuries lovers have tried all kinds of unappealing tricks to prevent pregnancy There was crocodile dung in ancient Egypt Aristotle s recommendation of cedar oil and Casanova s method of using half a lemon as a cervical cap But even the obvious modern alternative to the pill condoms have a failure rate Because people don t tend to use them exactly as they re supposed to they sometimes rip or slip So for every 100 sexually active women using condoms for a year 18 will become pregnant The failure rate of the sponge is similar The diaphragm isn t much better But the failure rate of the pill with typical use is just 6 three times safer than condoms Used perfectly the failure rate drops to one twentieth of that Using a condom meant negotiating with a partner The diaphragm and sponge were messy But the decision to use the pill was a woman s and it was private and discreet No wonder women wanted it The pill was first approved in the United States in 1960 In just five years almost half of married women on birth control were using it But the real revolution would come when unmarried women got access to oral contraceptives That took time But in around 1970 10 years after the pill was first approved US state after US state started to make it easier for single women to get the pill Universities opened family planning centres By the mid 1970s the pill was overwhelmingly the most popular form of contraception for 18 and 19 year old women in the US And that was when the economic revolution really began Women in America started studying particular kinds of degrees law medicine dentistry and MBAs which had previously been very masculine In 1970 medical degrees were over 90 male Law degrees and MBAs were over 95 male Dentistry degrees were 99 male But at the beginning of the 1970s equipped with the pill women surged into all these courses At first women made up a fifth of the class then a quarter By 1980 they often made up a third This wasn t simply because women became more likely to go to university Women who d already decided to be students opted for these professional courses The proportion of female students studying subjects such as medicine and law rose dramatically and logically enough the presence of women in the professions rose sharply shortly afterwards But what did this have to do with the pill By giving women control over their fertility it allowed them to invest in their careers Before the pill was available taking five years or more to qualify as a doctor or lawyer didn t look like a good use of time and money To reap the benefits of those courses a woman would need to be able to reliably delay motherhood until she was 30 at least Having a baby at the wrong time risked derailing her studies or delaying her professional progress A sexually active woman who tried to become a doctor dentist or lawyer was doing the equivalent of building a factory in an earthquake zone just one bit of bad luck and the expensive investment would be trashed Of course women could simply abstain from sex if they wanted to study for a professional career But many didn t want to And it wasn t just about having fun It was also about finding a husband Before the pill people married young A woman who decided to abstain from sex while developing her career might try to find a husband at the age of 30 and find that quite literally all the good men had been taken The pill changed both those dynamics It meant that unmarried women could have sex with substantially less risk of an unwanted pregnancy But it also changed the whole pattern of marriage Everyone started to marry later even women who didn t use the pill Babies started to arrive later and at a time of women s own choosing And that meant that women at least had time to establish a professional career Of course many other things changed for American women in the 1970s Abortion was legalised laws against sex discrimination were put in place feminism emerged as a movement and the drafting of young men to fight in Vietnam forced employers to recruit more women But a careful statistical study by the Harvard economists Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz strongly suggests that the pill must have played a major role in allowing women to delay marriage and motherhood and invest in their own careers Goldin and Katz tracked the availability of the pill to young women in the US state by state They show that as each state opened up access to contraception so the enrolment rate in professional courses soared and so did women s wages Grace Hopper s compiler Computing s hidden hero How economics killed the antibiotic dream Rise of the robots What advances mean for workers Superstar economics How the gramophone changed everything A few years ago the economist Amalia Miller used a variety of clever statistical methods to demonstrate that if a woman in her 20s was able to delay motherhood by one year her lifetime earnings would rise by 10 That was some measure of the vast advantage to a woman of completing her studies and securing her career before having children But the young women of the 1970s didn t need to see Amalia Miller s research they already knew it was true As the pill became available they signed up for long professional courses in undreamt of numbers American women today can look across the Pacific Ocean for a vision of an alternative reality In Japan one of the world s most technologically advanced societies the pill wasn t approved for use until 1999 Japanese women had to wait 39 years longer than their American counterparts for the same contraceptive In contrast when the erection boosting drug Viagra was approved in the US Japan was just a few months behind Gender inequality in Japan is widely reckoned to be worse than anywhere else in the developed world with women continuing to struggle for recognition in the workplace It is impossible to disentangle cause and effect here but the experience in the US

those differing pressures Dani Bolser thought she d finally cracked it when she started her new job as a receptionist for an events company It started off quite well but suddenly my bosses were asking me to come in a little bit earlier or can you work a little bit later she says It just turned into something very high pressured It wasn t her first attempt to get back into work After the birth of my first child I ve tried part time full time and working weekends And no matter what I tried it either broke into precious family time or it just wasn t financially viable for our family So at the age of 28 Dani started her own business DeluxeBlooms last year She now designs and sells luxury faux flowers from her kitchen table in Ilkley west Yorkshire My husband encouraged me she says I ve always been creative It kind of fits with my love of flowers Now I can choose how much work I do It s basically about that flexibility to say for instance you know what the kids are sick work just gets put on hold and allows you to be a mum first and for me that s just priceless It turns out there are thousands of women just like Dani who are shunning the traditional nine to five job in search of flexibility and more control over their working lives New research from Oxford Economics shows that one in 170 people in the UK now works for a small creative business making and selling unique

2006 to more than 5 700 today In the last 10 years thousands of creative small businesses have emerged all over the UK creating jobs driving wealth creation and contributing significantly to the

as well as writing a host of cookbooks But last year she decided to gain some new skills through Digital Mums a company which trains mums to be job ready to kick start their careers in digital and social media and crucially to keep a healthy work life balance I realised that the world was moving that the kind of jobs I wanted to get I wasn t going to get unless I kept up with the digital world says Laura She now manages social media for Wyevale Garden Centres and says she can work from anywhere Digital Mums has so far helped nearly 1 000 mums and businesses I m not chained to a desk says Laura I do work at home but being freelance and mobile means I can go to a cafe if I have to meet someone I can work as I go Having that flexibility is important It means I am there when my family is there It s important to be around especially as children grow up And she s not concerned about working remotely I ve never actually met my boss she says I work within marketing and for the head of marketing who I ve never met So I miss out on the office banter It doesn t bother me because I feel I ve done that bit the office job I m not interested any more I like the fact that it doesn t really matter what I wear or whether I ve brushed my hair in the morning I m lucky because I have a nice working relationship with my company Laura and Dani are thriving on their newfound paths as they set their own work life agenda It s pushed me into assessing my life a bit more what do I really want to do I think the minute you strip that back and look at what makes you happy you can achieve great

many from pursuing good cases Reality Check says There is evidence for this and charging fees for employment tribunals has led to a bigger fall in the number of claims than the government expected The Liberal Democrats have said they would scrap employment tribunal fees in order to strengthen enforcement of employment rights The fees were introduced when they were in government with the Conservatives in July 2013 taking a case to an employment tribunal had previously been free At the time one of the reasons it gave was that fees could disincentivise unreasonable behaviour like pursuing weak or vexatious claims Weak claims are presumably ones that are less likely to be successful while strong ones would be more likely to be successful The Labour manifesto said the party would reverse the unfair employment tribunal fees which literally price people out of justice There was no mention of employment tribunals in the Conservative or UKIP manifestos Employment tribunals are devolved we ll start with the situation in England and Wales Individual claimants now have to pay a claim fee of 160 or 250 depending on the type of case and a further 230 or 950 if the case goes to a hearing There is means tested help available with paying tribunal fees If you win the case then your employer might be forced to pay your tribunal fees but that is not automatic After the fees were introduced the average number of total cases fell from about 5 000 a month to about 1 500 a month The government had a review earlier this year to look at the impact of charging fees It concluded that the introduction of fees had been successful in the sense that it had raised 8 5m to 9m a year and encouraged people to use free mediation services but it also said that The fall in claims has been significantly greater than was estimated when fees were first introduced As a result the government is consulting on whether changes are needed to the Help with Fees scheme to make it easier for people on lower incomes to get their fees paid Brian Doyle president of employment tribunals in England Wales said in his submission to the review We do not consider that there has been a reduction in weak or unmeritorious claims Had that been the case we would have expected the percentage of successful claims to have risen whereas in fact it has declined slightly Statistics presented as part of the review show that the proportion of successful claims fell from an average of 15 3 in the nine months before the introduction of charging 62 6 were withdrawn before a hearing to an average of 12 6 since then with 59 0 being withdrawn Cases are being upheld in the same proportions as ever there are just fewer winners and fewer losers Gareth Brahams from Brahams Dutt Badrick French who is chair of the Employment Lawyers Association told BBC News In Scotland fees are also charged for employment tribunals The Scottish National Party has promised to abolish them but has not yet done so It gained the power to do so as part of last year s Scotland Act The SNP has also pledged to abolish the fees as part of its Westminster campaign which means it wants to see them abolished in England and

in a dress she bought for 40 from Brixton market The couple met at the primary school where they worked With Josh on a working holiday visa from Australia to avoid being apart they were married six months later on a budget of 5 000 After their private ceremony at Wandsworth Town Hall in south west London they threw a party at the Dukes Head Pub in nearby Putney with 70 guests To keep costs low the couple enlisted friends and family to help with their big day A family friend baked their wedding cake while Katherine s cousin did their photography Another friend bought the flowers in bulk from New Covent Garden Market while the couple made their own invitations and thank you cards I have witnessed close friends planning large weddings with much greater budgets and it has shocked me by how

thinks couples are dispensing with tradition to throw a wedding that reflects their personalities and doesn t cost them their house deposit In the six years I have been in the industry things have changed massively Brides have become much more individual in their tastes they don t want the traditional anymore It s been led by the desire to have something a bit more personal now that DIY weddings have become a lot more popular She also notes that brides no longer expect their parents to foot the bill A lot more brides now tend to pay for their dresses themselves Their mum or dad might pay when they were in their early 20s but now our brides are usually in their late 20s to early 30s and they have their own careers Imogen Veitch 27 spent just 200 on her wedding outfit buying a wedding dress from China on eBay She and husband James also went down the DIY route to keep their wedding within a strict 6 000 budget The pair made all of the wedding decorations themselves and created their own floral centrepieces They married at Sandy Balls holiday park in Hampshire at a cost of 4 000 We knew we had limited savings and didn t want it all to go on one day says Imogen We aren t extravagant people so if we had an extravagant wedding it would have felt forced and uncomfortable Both of us have said we honestly wouldn t change a single thing about our wedding day It was the best day our lives As it is socially accepted that weddings are expensive I think lots of couples just bite the bullet and go all out some even taking out loans And if you are spending 20 000 or more on a wedding I can see how people get so stressed out You need everything to go perfectly or it seems a waste of money But I can say we were honestly stress free for the entire planning process

effectively had two weddings when she married husband Dan one in the day at Childerley Hall in Cambridgeshire with 60 guests and then an evening reception at her parents home with a further 80 She estimates the combined cost was around 50 000 We didn t have any budget We were fortunate that our parents were paying for the wedding so if we wanted to do something we could Daisy says Having a big girly wedding wasn t on the agenda Instead food was a big focal point of the day for the couple who both work in catering Their evening reception included a street food market with six different trucks offering everything from fish and chips to ice cream and crepes The ceremony was a bit of a blur but I wouldn t change anything says Daisy There were things we definitely wanted to include and we didn t have to sacrifice anything so it definitely took the pressure off As part of the experience generation even the wealthiest young brides and grooms don t want their day to be all about

Mariah Carey and Jennifer Lopez The millennial generation are certainly far more concerned with the guest experience than they are with showing off which is a wonderful change to how it was 10 years

the tiny Mediterranean island was a pirate base for tax avoidance it sent ripples of concern across the EU Malta currently holds the presidency of the European Union so the allegations are all the more sensitive And they come at the tail end of a bitter election campaign that has seen the island s Labour government fending off serious claims of corruption ahead of a vote on 3 June Malta operates a tax system where companies pay the lowest tax on profits in the EU While local businesses must pay 35 on profits international corporations profit from a corporation tax rate of as little as 5 thanks to a complex system where shareholders can receive a tax refund of up to six sevenths of their tax paid in Malta The average rate in the EU is around 22 Several EU countries say such a system damages their budgets and reveals a weakness in the EU which allows the 28 member states sovereign rights over their taxation According to a report commissioned by Green MEPs in the European Parliament Malta helped multinationals avoid paying 14bn 12bn 15 6bn in taxes between 2012 and 2015 which would have gone to other EU countries Juncker under fire over Luxembourg s tax regime The EU

the Maltese tax system They also claimed Malta had become a target for firms linked to the Italian mafia and Russian loan sharks It came just two weeks after Norbert Walter Borjans the finance minister in Germany s most populous state North Rhine Westphalia singled out Malta as the Panama of Europe What are the Panama Papers all about It is a highly sensitive subject for Malta s leadership

companies in Panama Malta says it is under siege insisting big countries are anxious to bite off a good chunk of revenue made by the EU s smallest state The tax system has been jealously guarded by different Maltese governments with successive prime ministers arguing there is nothing secretive about Malta s registry of companies and that controlling tax policy is the only tool left for small EU countries to remain competitive Malta country profile After the Malta Files were divulged Finance Minister Edward Scicluna told reporters Do not underestimate the attempts to bully a small country Mr Scicluna has striven to explain that the Maltese authorities share company and banking information whenever asked to do so by foreign jurisdictions Prime Minister Joseph Muscat added Our register is more transparent than Germany s or Luxembourg s Our competitive edge is like giving a manufacturing company land on the cheap to encourage it to set up a factory in our country Ex Finance Minister

my tax rates to please Germany or France A lot of countries should look at the way their tax system has killed off business and led to unemployment Mr Fenech served for nine years as finance minister and oversaw the tax system when Malta joined the EU in 2004 He said the island had nothing to hide Its corporate tax system was sanctioned by the Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development OECD and is in line with the EU s freedom of establishment Mr Fenech insisted there was no fool proof system anywhere to weed out questionable companies There s VAT evasion money laundering all over

Greece In 1743 at the Palace of Versailles Louis XV used one for clandestine visits to and from his mistress The power for Louis s secret love lift was supplied by a chap in a chimney breast standing ready to haul on a rope when required Other lifts in Hungary China and Egypt were powered by animals Steam power went further Matthew Boulton and James Watt giants of Britain s industrial revolution produced steam engines that ran muscular industrial lifts that hauled coal up from the mines But while these lifts worked well enough you wouldn t want to use them to lift people to any serious height because inevitably something would go wrong The lift would plunge down the shaft loose ends of the rope flapping in the darkness passengers screaming into oblivion Most people can walk up five flights of stairs if they must Nobody would want to take a lift to such a deadly height So what mattered was making a lift that was not only safe but demonstrably safe Both the innovation and the demonstration fell to a man named Elisha Otis At the 1853 World s Fair in New York Otis climbed on to a platform which was hoisted high above a crowd of onlookers nervy with anticipation The entire contraption looked a little like an executioner s scaffold Behind Otis stood a man with an axe He swung down on to the rope the crowd gasped Otis platform shuddered but did not plunge All safe gentlemen all safe boomed Otis The city landscape was about to be turned on its head by the man who had invented not the lift but the lift brake Turned on its head is right because the lift transformed where a building s highest status areas were located When the furthest reaches of a six or seven storey building were accessed only after an arduous climb they tended to be the servants quarters or the artist s garret After the lift the attic became the loft apartment the penthouse The lift flourished alongside two complementary sets of innovations the steel and reinforced concrete that made it practical to build tall buildings and the undergrounds and other mass transit systems that could bring large numbers of people into dense urban cores In the quintessential high rise centre Manhattan lifts and the underground are symbiotic Without the density that the skyscrapers provide it would be hard to run an underground system efficiently Without the underground system nobody would be able to get to the skyscrapers The result is a surprisingly green urban environment more than 80 of Manhattanites travel to work on the underground or by bike or on foot 10 times the rate for America as a whole A similar story can be told for high rise cities across the planet from Singapore to Sydney They tend to be highly desirable places to live as witnessed by people s willingness to pay high rents They re creative as measured by a large output of patents and a high rate of start ups They re rich as measured by economic output per person And relative to rural and suburban areas they are environmental utopias with low rates of energy use per person and low consumption of petrol How a razor revolutionised the way we pay for stuff Rise of the robots What advances mean for workers Battery bonanza From frogs legs to mobiles and electric cars Superstar economics How the gramophone changed everything This minor miracle wealth and vitality in a modest environmental footprint would be impossible without the lift Yet the lift seems unfairly underrated We hold it to a higher standard than other forms of transport We re pleased if we only have to wait a couple of minutes for a bus or a train but we grumble if we have to wait 20 seconds for a lift Many people are nervous of lifts yet they are safe at least 10 times safer than escalators Frankly the lift is a faithful servant that is too often ignored Perhaps as Nick Paumgarten once suggested in the New Yorker magazine this is because using a lift feels almost like being teleported the doors close there is a shift in the feeling of gravity the doors open again and you re somewhere else There is so little sense of place that without signs and LED displays we wouldn t have a clue which floor we were emerging into While we take the lift for granted it continues to evolve The challenges of ever taller skyscrapers are being met by super light lift ropes and by computer controllers that will allow two cars to shuttle up and down a single shaft independently one above the other But often the older simpler ideas still work for example making the wait for a lift pass more quickly by putting full length mirrors in the lobby And lifts are naturally energy efficient because their cars have counterweights There s always room for improvement of course The Empire State Building still the most iconic skyscraper in the world was recently retrofitted in a 500m 387m project effort to reduce the building s carbon emissions The retrofit included lifts with regenerative brakes so that when a full car comes down or an empty car heads up the lift supplies power back to the building But the truth is that the Empire State Building was always energy efficient by the simple virtue of being a densely packed vertical structure next to an underground station One of the organisations that designed the building s retrofit is visionary environmental organisation the Rocky Mountain Institute whose super efficient environmentally sustainable headquarters is built high in the Rockies 180 miles 290km away from the nearest public transit system Staff have to drive to work and even shuttle between buildings a mile or more apart Of course the RMI is a showcase for environmentally efficient design ideas including high tech window coatings krypton filled triple glazing a water reuse system and energy saving heat exchanges But one of the most environmentally friendly technologies is on display in buildings all around us It s a green mode of transport that moves billions of people every year and yet is so overlooked that it can hide in plain sight Tim Harford writes the Financial Times s Undercover Economist column 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy is broadcast on the BBC World

another claim to fame Over the last decade house prices here have risen faster than any other seaside town in Britain According to the Halifax prices have nearly doubled from an average of 70 000 in 2006 to 137 000 in 2016 Over the period many parts of Aberdeenshire saw large increases as a result of the oil boom For similar reasons Lerwick in the Shetlands experienced a 77 rise in prices making it the seaside town with the second fastest growth On average the cost of a home by the sea rose by 25 during the last decade or 382 a month the Halifax said The strongest performing coastal towns in terms of growth have been in north of the border in Scotland where property prices on the Aberdeenshire coastline have been helped by the oil industry more than the sunshine said Martin Ellis Halifax s chief economist Sandbanks in Dorset where houses regularly sell for more than 6m remained the most expensive seaside town for the second year running Many houses and flats on this narrow bank of sand have wonderful views over the Solent or Poole Harbour The average home here is worth 664 000 Being by the seaside does come at a price with the marked increase in house prices reflecting the demand for rooms with a sea view said Mr Ellis The second most expensive seaside town is Salcombe on the Kingsbridge estuary in Devon where average prices are 618 000 At the other end of the scale many of the least expensive towns are in the north Port Bannatyne on the Isle of Bute is the cheapest seaside town with average prices of 72 000 Next cheapest is Newbiggin by the Sea in

upmarket mixer drinks maker Fever Tree has netted 73m after selling a 3 9 stake in the company Deputy chairman Charles Rolls almost doubled the number of shares he intended to sell following significant demand from investors He sold 4 5 million shares at 16 25 each but retains an 11 2 stake The tonic water group has seen its share price rise more than 900 since it floated in late 2014 This year alone shares in the group have risen more than 50 Fever Tree s international sales have expanded rapidly and more than 50 of its revenues now come from outside the UK Mr Rolls founded the company with Tim Warrillow in 2004 It is named after the colloquial term for the cinchona tree from whose bark the natural anti malarial drug and core tonic water ingredient quinine is produced The pair wanted to produce an upmarket tonic with no artificial sweeteners preservatives and flavourings"]
