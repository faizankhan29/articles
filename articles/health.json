of three died of measles in the city of Essen this week The government wants kindergartens to report any parents who cannot prove they have had a medical consultation However Germany is not yet making it an offence to refuse vaccinations unlike Italy Speaking to the popular daily Bild Mr Gr he said Continuing deaths from measles cannot leave anyone indifferent Under the plan the children of parents who fail to seek vaccination advice could be expelled from their daycare centre The law is expected to be adopted next month The upper house of the German parliament the Bundesrat said forcing kindergartens to report some parents to the health authorities might breach data protection laws Italy has recorded nearly three times more measles cases so far this year than for all of 2016 Last week the Italian government ruled that parents must vaccinate their children against 12 common illnesses before enrolling them at state run schools The list includes measles polio whooping cough and hepatitis B Measles outbreak across Europe WHO information on measles By mid April this year Germany had 410 measles cases compared with 325 for the whole of 2016 the Robert Koch Institute reported The institute said that besides children all adults born since 1970 should get immunised against measles if they had not had the measles jab or had had it only once Last week a German court ruled that a father could insist on having his child vaccinated over the objections of the mother The case concerned a separated couple and the child was living with the mother Italian officials have attacked what they call anti scientific theories which have led to vaccination rates falling well below levels deemed safe to prevent outbreaks Those theories include a long discredited link between autism and the MMR measles mumps and rubella vaccine A 2010 survey of vaccinations EU wide and in Iceland and Norway found much variation in policy The Venice project survey reported that 15 countries had no mandatory vaccinations and the rest had at least one mandatory vaccination The level of compliance was high including in countries where vaccinations were recommended not mandatory The report concluded that the label mandatory is not the only driver behind achieving a high vaccination coverage and many other factors can play a role such as the use of combined vaccines prices for the recipient kind of offer information and promotional campaigns The World Health Organization WHO says that since the introduction of two doses of anti measles vaccine across Europe the number of cases has dropped sharply The total in 2016 about 5 000 was the lowest ever recorded But 14 European countries are described as endemic for measles and most cases this year were reported in seven of them France Germany Italy Poland Romania Switzerland and Ukraine The largest outbreaks are in Italy and Romania the WHO says The second measles jab needs to be administered to at least 95 of the population the WHO says a level not reached in the endemic countries Children should be screened for their measles vaccination history when they start school and those lacking evidence of receipt of two doses should be vaccinated the WHO says", "Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window Labour has begun setting out its plan for the NHS in England if the party wins in June This includes a pay increase for staff putting into law the mandatory minimum number of staff per patient and funding training for health professionals Speaking to BBC Radio 4 s Today programme Labour s shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth said the money for these pledges would be raised by increasing corporation tax How much will need to be raised has not yet been confirmed Corporation tax the tax on companies profits has been cut from 28 in 2010 to 19 and is due to come down to 17 by 2020 Labour used official figures to calculate that between 2016 17 and 2021 22 cuts to corporation tax would amount to 64bn less in the public purse We are talking about the NHS in England only since health is a devolved matter and the other nations administrations generally set their own policies For example although the recommendations of pay review bodies are UK wide nations get to choose whether to accept them It is unlikely that the precise figures behind Labour s policies will be available until the party s manifesto is published next month Even then we probably will not know exactly by how much pay will be increased and what level the minimum staffing will be set at so it s difficult to say exactly how much this all going to cost However we can estimate how much various elements of the pledge might cost Labour said it would increase pay to a sustainable level and lift the pay cap currently in force that means NHS staff pay has not increased by more than 1 a year for the past six years although many staff also get incremental pay rises to reflect progression within their roles We don t know exactly what a sustainable increase will be Mr Ashworth said the decision would be taken by an independent pay review body Paul Johnson director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank has estimated that every 1 pay rise would cost 500m a year Labour s own estimates put it at 350m but this excludes doctors When the government cut funding for health students by replacing grants with loans it calculated this would save the Treasury 800m so we can reasonably say reversing this cut would cost the same amount Labour also set out plans to introduce mandatory minimum staffing levels Sir Robert Francis report into the failings at the Mid Staffordshire Foundation Trust published in February 2013 found low levels of staffing were linked to poor care and recommended minimum safe staffing levels should be drawn up The Public Accounts Committee a cross party group of MPs responsible for overseeing government expenditure estimated last year that the NHS was short staffed by about 50 000 Employing this number of extra people could cost about 2 3bn depending on how many of them were nurses doctors or in other roles The NHS spends about 40bn a year on front line staff Another 50 000 staff would be about a 6 increase to the total number of NHS staff caring for patients amounting to an extra 2 4bn on the pay bill This is a very rough estimate Mr Ashworth also pointed out that hiring more staff and raising their pay would help reduce the NHS s dependency on agency workers who cost the health service more than salaried employees In 2015 agency nurses cost on average an estimated 39 per hour compared with 27 per hour for NHS staff bank nurses However this is not the only way Labour has promised to spend the extra money from raising corporation tax Since Jeremy Corbyn became leader of the party in 2015 Labour has pledged to raise corporation tax to fund Read more from

Doctors in the UK routinely lied to patients with disorders of sex development known as intersex conditions the BBC has found A leading paediatric consultant told BBC Radio 4 that withholding the truth of patients diagnoses had been widespread Jeanette now 71 was operated on at the age of 16 to remove her hidden testes She discovered the truth only when she was 50 Jeanette was born with complete androgen insensitivity CAIS a genetic disorder occurring in between one in 20 000 and one in 60 000 births A child born with CAIS is genetically male but their body does not respond to the hormone testosterone properly so the external appearance of their genitals will look entirely female Jeanette was 12 when doctors told her mother that Jeanette would not develop like other girls or be able to have a baby Jeanette says I couldn t understand at that point why she my mum was crying and what was wrong with me Then at 14 I started realising that things were not right with me as I never had periods or anything Two years later aged 16 Jeanette was taken to hospital and operated on still unaware of her diagnosis At that time she was told nothing just that she needed major surgery I ve got an 8in 20cm scar right across my stomach I was feeling perfectly healthy and I can remember sitting up in up in bed thinking What the hell am I doing here Surgeons had removed internal testes from Jeanette s body but Jeanette didn t even know she had them and doctors didn t tell her why they had operated Life became very difficult for Jeanette At 28 she got married but found sex with her husband too painful I was in so much pain afterwards I couldn t walk So my mother came with me to hospital and they told me Go home things will get better She left her partner two years later saying she was too frightened to have another physical relationship She did not find out the truth about her medical history until she was 50 when saw the words testicular feminisation another term for CAIS on the front her medical file by chance at an outpatient appointment She talked with her GP who then gave her her medical records to read I read my notes and that s when it said I had the womb the size of a matchstick and two fully grown testes and I cried my eyes out Ieuan Hughes emeritus professor of paediatrics at the University of Cambridge and an expert in hormone disorders says cover ups used to be routine in cases such as this In those days the consensus in the medical profession was that the truth would not be disclosed to the patient and the general advice was for parents not to disclose the true diagnoses to the children The explanation for why the person could not have periods could not have children a story was spun that the ovaries had not developed properly and were at risk of developing cancer therefore they needed to be removed He says a number of women who had been told a pack of lies by the medical profession have since contacted the Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome Support Group AISSG with which he works Apparently there had been a couple of examples where patients had been so upset they had taken their own lives sadly A AISSG representative told the BBC the practice of routinely withholding the truth from patients didn t stop until 2012 British Association of Paediatric Urologists president Stuart O Toole said most patients were now managed within a team with input from specialist surgeons and medics and psychologists The parents of the child are involved at every stage Irreversible surgery is rarely performed in infancy and a gonad would be removed only if there was a credible risk of cancer The British Medical Association the doctors union declined to comment but General Medical Council chief executive Charlie Massey said Medical practice has evolved dramatically over the last 50 years with more and more emphasis on working in partnership with patients openly and honestly Our guidance makes it clear doctors should involve children and young people as much as possible in discussions about their care even if they are not able to make decisions on their own We are clear that doctors should not withhold information from patients unless they believe that giving it would cause the patient serious harm Holly Greenbury who co founded Intersex UK a campaign group founded to end stigma around intersex variations and to fight for equality and protection of intersex people told BBC Radio 4 that some families were still feeling forced to make decisions over surgery in the UK before children were of an age at which they could make an informed decision and consent themselves What this highlights is that there is a break down of communication a lack of education and currently the UK is not following internal human rights law and ensuring that our legislation protects the future wellbeing and the bodily autonomy of infants and young children Malta became the first country to outlaw non consensual medical interventions on intersex in 2015 Intersex UK is one of several British organisations now lobbying for corrective surgery to be outlawed in the UK", "Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger

environment of space The Japanese team behind the gravity breaking experiment on the International Space Station ISS say it shows that transporting the seeds of life away from Earth is feasible Sperm banks could even be made on the Moon as a back up for Earth disasters they told a leading science journal It is unclear if this will ever help humans populate space however Sustaining life in space is challenging to say the least On the ISS radiation is more than 100 times higher than on Earth The average daily dose of 0 5mSv from the cosmic rays is enough to damage the DNA code inside living cells including sperm Microgravity also does strange things to sperm In 1988 German researchers sent a sample of bull semen into orbit on a rocket and discovered that sperm were able to swim much faster in low gravity although it was not clear whether this gave a fertility advantage Another space test showed fish eggs could be fertilised and develop normally during a 15 day orbital flight suggesting a brief trip into space might not be too harmful for reproduction at least for vertebrates The freeze dried mouse sperm samples were stored on the space station for nine months before being sent back down to Earth and thawed at room temperature Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reports Although sperm DNA was slightly damaged by the trip it still did the job of fertilising mouse eggs and creating apparently healthy space pups Fertilisation and birth rates were similar to healthy ground control mice The space pups had only minor differences in their genetic code and grew to adulthood A select few were allowed to mate and became mums and dads themselves The researchers Sayaka Wakayama and colleagues from the University of Yamanashi suspect some of the sperm DNA damage is repaired by the egg once it has been fertilised If sperm samples are to be preserved for longer periods in space then it is likely that DNA damage will increase and exceed the limit of the egg oocyte s capacity for repair If the DNA damage occurring during long term preservation is found to have a significant effect on offspring we will need to develop methods to protect sperm samples against space radiation such as an ice shield they said Once they ve cracked that they can set their sights on the Moon sperm banks Underground storage on the Moon such as in lava tubes could be among the best places for prolonged or permanent sperm preservation because of their very low temperatures protection from space radiation by thick bedrock layers and complete isolation from any disasters on Earth the scientists say But that still leaves the massive question of whether mammals including us humans can permanently live and procreate in space Mouse and human studies so far suggest perhaps not Prof Joseph Tash a Nasa supported physiologist at the University of Kansas Medical Center said although the latest findings were interesting the ISS was a somewhat sheltered environment to use as the test zone for space The ISS orbit is within the protection of the Van Allen radiation belt the magnetic field that diverts most high energy radiation particles from hitting the earth or the ISS He said the actual risk of radiation damage at the Moon and beyond would be much higher Ovaries and testes are the most sensitive organs to both acute and chronic radiation exposure He said the feasibility of mammalian reproduction in space beyond the Van Allen belt would depend on the creation of radiation hardened facilities that could protect sperm eggs and embryos from harm Given the nine month gestation for humans the pregnant mother would also need to be protected by such a facility So it presents very real habitat medical social and psychological questions that need to be

window Further evidence has emerged of the link between alcohol consumption in women and an increased risk of breast cancer According to a report from the World Cancer Research Fund half a glass of wine or a small beer a day increases the risk of breast cancer It also backs up research showing that regular intensive exercise can reduce the risk of the disease Breast cancer is by far the most common cancer in women in the UK with one in eight women developing the disease during their lifetime But scientists say they can t explain why the cancer occurs in some people and not in others There are numerous causes and lots of factors to take into account including lifestyle hormone levels and other medical conditions Basically it s a complex picture and there s no point focusing on one factor only For a start there are some factors you cannot control such as your sex age height genes and when you started your periods Being a woman over 50 and past the menopause and having a history of breast cancer in your family all increase your risk of getting the disease Being tall and starting periods before the age of 12 are thought to increase the risk too Cancer Research UK lists 18 different factors which could cause breast cancer to some degree Alcohol is only one of them It says there are ways women can lower their risk of breast cancer by focusing on factors they can control like diet weight and exercise After analysing more than 100 studies that examined the medical history of 12 million women the report backs up current advice to be aware of alcohol consumption The report found evidence that drinking an extra small glass of wine every day 10g of alcohol increases a woman s risk of breast cancer after the menopause by 9 It means that in a group of 100 women around 13 would be likely to develop breast cancer anyway And if they all drank an additional small glass of wine every day one extra case might develop among the original group When it comes to exercise the report found that doing more vigorous exercise like cycling or running cut the risk of post menopausal breast cancer by 10 compared to the least active women Breastfeeding was also found to lower the risk of the disease before and after the menopause And there was limited evidence that eating more leafy vegetables such as cabbage spinach and kale decreased the risk of a less common kind of breast cancer We already know that regular physical exercise eating a balanced diet and maintaining a healthy weight are important for reducing the risk of lots of diseases including cancers But scientists say all these factors interact with each other and that makes it difficult to tease out which ones are driving the cancer and to what extent New guidelines were introduced in 2016 which said that men and women should drink no more than 14 units a week equivalent to six pints of beer or seven glasses of wine and some days should be free of alcohol altogether The UK s chief medical officers advice was based on research which showed that any amount of alcohol can increase the risk of cancer Pregnant women are advised not to drink at all Cancer experts say the findings don t tell us anything new about the link between alcohol and breast cancer which is already well known But if you can to stack the odds in your favour they say it is a good idea to have some alcohol free days during every week and not to increase your drinking However Cancer Research UK says there is no need be alarmed and go teetotal It is also important to look at the bigger picture Drinking alcohol has a greater effect on the risks of several other cancers including mouth liver and bowel than it does on breast cancer so there is no reason to become fixated on alcohol Kevin McConway emeritus professor of applied statistics at the Open University says the risks have to be set against whatever pleasure women might obtain from their drinking The report does not provide absolute risks and as such Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter from the University of Cambridge said it did not seem a good basis for recommending that women give up alcohol completely However Dr Anne McTiernan lead report author and cancer expert at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle said the evidence regarding breast cancer was clear Having a physically active lifestyle maintaining a healthy weight throughout life and limiting alcohol are all steps women can take to lower their risk", "Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window I was born in India and as a young child I developed a serious gut infection that would have killed me if it hadn t been for antibiotics These days a young child in India with the same condition would be far more vulnerable because of the huge and rapid rise in antibiotic resistance in that part of the world The problem is not of course confined to India It s estimated that antibiotic resistant infections currently kill at least 700 000 people a year This is projected to rise to 10 million by 2050 What is particularly worrying is that as well as the emergence of antibiotic resistance and the threat it poses there have been no new classes of antibiotics released in the past 30 years I wanted to make a documentary that explores the reasons behind the rise of the superbugs and what progress is being made to find new ways to counter them The producer of the documentary Peter Gauvain was keen to expose me to some of the more unpleasant superbugs around and then see if we could treat them Since this was clearly unwise we compromised by creating life size models of my head and body out of a nutrient rich jelly called agar We used my body doubles whom we dubbed Microbial Michael to experiment on The results were fascinating and rather disturbing We started by swabbing my real body and then wiping these microbes on to my body double The right hand side of Microbial Michael had previously been saturated with a powerful broad spectrum antibiotic How long would the antibiotic hold the bacteria at bay Answer not long at all Within days both sides of my body had become a battlefield of competing microbes some of them quite nasty pathogens So what about novel treatments The encouraging thing is that we did come across a number of different approaches to fighting the threat of antibiotic resistance that were promising One of the oldest approaches which in the West is only now coming back into fashion is the use of viruses to attack bacteria Just as we are prone to viral infections such as the common cold so are bacteria The viruses that infect and kill bacteria are known as bacteriophages or phages It s been estimated there are more than 10 million trillion trillion phages around which is more than every other organism on Earth combined Phages were first discovered more than a century ago and have been used to treat bacterial infections in a number of specialised centres in Central and Eastern Europe ever since There s a clinic in Poland where they use phage therapy on patients who have infections that are resistant to every known antibiotic There we met a woman called Boguslawo who had developed an infection in her leg after stepping on a rusty nail which neither antibiotics nor conventional therapy could heal Faced with the choice of trying phages or having her leg amputated she put her faith in the phages and so far that faith seems to be justified Dr Alex Betts of Oxford University is one of a handful of scientists in the UK currently working with phages and he kindly agreed to demonstrate their effectiveness by infecting my agar double with a superbug called pseudomonas This causes septicaemia an infection of the blood and pneumonia both of which can be fatal In short it s nasty He swabbed my agar face with a multi drug resistant strain of pseudomonas and then covered part of it with a small bandage impregnated with phages Some time later when we examined my infected face under ultraviolet light it was clear that the phages had done their work All the rest of the face had been colonised by pseudomonas apart from the small patch where he had put the phage bandage There have been no proper clinical trials of phage therapy in the UK yet so they won t be seen outside of the lab any time soon But I m convinced that these viruses are packed with potential As Dr Betts explained one of the great advantages of phage therapy is there is less risk of bacteria developing resistance Phages need to infect bacteria in order to survive he said And if antibiotic resistance evolves they can co evolve rapidly They re not going to replace antibiotics but there are certain roles that they can fill that will ease the pressure on our existing therapeutics buy us time to develop new antimicrobials And phages can certainly be used alongside antibiotics As well as phages we also tried infecting and then treating my body double with a novel antibiotic derived from ants discovered by Prof Matt Hutchings and his team at the University of East Anglia This time we infected my face with the superbug MRSA methycyliin resistant staph aureus which I m pleased to say the ant antibiotic was able to fight off Prof Hutchings is cautiously excited about their discovery as he is well aware that developing new drugs is hugely expensive and can take a great deal of time And with a potential antibiotic apocalypse approaching fast time is not on our side Michael Mosley vs The

cautious about using them to judge what to eat Stanford University scientists said The study recommended that companies release data showing how their devices work out measurements The accuracy of seven wrist devices were tested while 60 volunteers were asked to walk run and cycle Researchers found that six out of seven of the fitness devices were good at estimating the heart rate of the person wearing it with an error rate under 5 They were the Apple Watch Fitbit Surge Basis Peak Microsoft Band PulseOn and Mio Alpha 2 but the Samsung Gear S2 had the highest error rate of 6 8 However when it came to keeping track of energy used during exercise the five devices that performed this function were all a long way out Not one of the devices had an error rate below 20 and some such as the PulseOn were much more inaccurate the US research team found Dr Euan Ashley co author of the study from the department of cardiovascular medicine at Stanford University said the public should be aware of the strengths and limitations of fitness devices worn on the wrist People need to know that on energy expenditure they give rough estimates If you go to the gym and you think you ve lost 400 calories then you might feel you ve got 400 calories to play with he said That could be an issue if people were basing their diet on what they thought they had burnt off he said Technology for measuring heart rate had moved on quickly over the past five or six years but on energy expenditure it s not quite there yet he added It may be that companies are not using heart rates in their calculations There is also a very wide difference in calories burnt between one person and another For example 10 000 steps could equate to anything from 400 kilocalories to 800 kilocalories lost depending on a person s height and weight alone the study said Dr David Ellis lecturer in computation social science at Lancaster University said working out the number of calories burnt was a tricky business and relied on many different factors such as height weight percentage of body fat heart rate and more However because manufactures do not share the algorithms which are constantly updated used to determine calories burned it is almost impossible to know the exact source of error at this stage he said Fitness trackers can have a very positive effect on people s activity levels so complete 100 accuracy may not be vital if the devices are encouraging more exercise But recent trials have suggested that wearing them doesn t always result in a positive outcome or improve the chances of losing weight The researchers urged companies to be more transparent and publish the results of their own accuracy tests They said this would ensure the public and clinicians were aware of the devices limitations The Stanford team has set up their own website to share this kind of data with others", "Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn

fresh investigations into the death of Matthew Leahy who was found hanged at Linden Centre in 2012 His mother Melanie Leahy said her talks with Essex Police suggested the cases had taken place in the last 17 years The Essex NHS Trust said patient safety was a top priority Essex Police told the BBC s Victoria Derbyshire programme it was conducting initial enquiries into a number of deaths which have occurred at the Linden Centre since 2000 A full investigation may take place later depending on the outcome Matthew Leahy was admitted to the Linden Centre in Chelmsford in 2012 aged 20 after his mental health problems had spiralled following cannabis use He also suffered hallucinations His mother Melanie said staff told her not to go to see her son for the first seven days to let him settle on the ward A week later she was called by a doctor who informed her that her son had hanged himself She said he had told her in a text earlier that week he was in hell Two years later an inquest concluded Mr Leahy had been subjected to a series of failings and missed opportunities over a long period of time Each patient supposedly has a care plan and it came to light that Matthew had no care plan Ms Leahy explained He had no key worker no one knew anything for two days There wasn t even any observation sheets Following the inquest the coroner suggested the trust hold a public inquiry into his death but the trust said it would take funding away from front line services Ms Leahy said Essex Police had confirmed they were still investigating my son s death but are also looking at up to 20 patients all who died by the same means One nurse who left the trust in mid 2016 after a decade and wished to remain anonymous said ligature points features in a room that can be used to kill oneself had been identified many years before Mr Leahy s death but had not been resolved If you asked too many questions you were deemed as a troublemaker and things made difficult for you he said The Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust said the history of serious incidents at the Linden Centre was of great concern It added it was improving systems to ensure that investigations are carried out rigorously During an inspection of the Linden Centre in August 2015 by the regulator the CQC inspectors reported that one patient attempted to strangle themselves with a ligature A year later they found safety was still a concern The trust must ensure that action is taken to remove identified ligature risks the report said Last week an inquest jury found that another patient Richard Wade died in May 2015 at the Linden Centre after staff failed to remove a dressing gown cord that he used to take his own life Patient suicides have also taken place in other areas of the trust In 2016 Melanie Lowe was admitted to hospital under the care of the trust after her mental health made her increasingly unstable She took an overdose with pills from her own washbag and when admitted to hospital remained on constant watch But her observation levels were later downgraded form constant watch to the minimum level required Ms Lowe took her own life suffocating herself At the inquest last November the coroner heard evidence of a catalogue of mistakes Lawyer Rachel Codd representing Ms Lowe s family said she had tried to abscond twice while on constant watch but the locum psychiatrist who

months and was utterly horrible During this time social media made me feel worse as I would constantly compare myself to other people and make myself feel bad When I was 19 I had another bad

participants a series of questions about whether YouTube Instagram Snapchat Facebook and Twitter had an impact on their health and well being Participants were asked to score each platform on 14 health and well being issues Based on these ratings YouTube was considered to have the most positive impact on mental health followed by Twitter and then Facebook Snapchat and Instagram were given the lowest scores overall Shirley Cramer chief executive of the RSPH said It is interesting to see Instagram and Snapchat ranking as the worst for mental health and well being both platforms are very image focused and it appears they may be driving feelings of inadequacy and anxiety in young people In light of the findings public health experts are calling for social media platforms to introduce a series of checks and measures to help tackle mental health including The report also recommends that NHS England comes up with a vetting scheme for health and well being information so young people are better able to judge whether information is trustworthy Ms Cramer added As the evidence grows that there may be potential harms from heavy use of social media and as we upgrade the status of

people living in isolated villages in Greece may enjoy long and healthy lives They found a new genetic variant common among villagers which appears to protect the heart by lowering levels of bad fats and cholesterol Despite a diet rich in animal fat the people of Mylopotamos in northern Crete do not suffer from cardiovascular disease And they really love their cheese The isolated villages of Zoniana and Anogia are high up in the mountains on the island of Crete Few people move in or out of the villages and the inhabitants are known for living well into old age Heart problems heart attacks and strokes all types of cardiovascular disease are rare and that s despite a diet which includes plenty of lamb and local Cretan cheese There is a cheese festival held every year in the villages by the way Well this kind of diet would normally be a recipe for lots of health complications That s because eating foods that contain saturated fats raises the level of cholesterol in the blood and high levels of low density lipoprotein LDL cholesterol in the blood increase the risk of heart disease and stroke The villagers do get type 2 diabetes at the same rate as the general Greek population but they don t seem to suffer from the usual consequences such as diabetic kidney disease That s exactly what researchers from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute wanted to know Was there something in the villagers genetic make up that protected their hearts against disease Their research published in Nature Communications identified a new genetic variant which has heart protecting qualities It is associated with lower levels of bad natural fats and bad cholesterol which are important for lowering the risk of cardiovascular disease The variant appears to be virtually unique to the population of the two mountain villages Out of thousands of Europeans who have undergone genome sequencing only one other person in Italy possesses this variant the researchers said To solve the puzzle they sequenced the entire genome of 250 villagers That means they took blood samples extracted the DNA the operating instructions for each one of us which determine how we look and who we are and analysed a string of three billion letters which make up their human genome Then they used the results to get a more detailed view of more than 3 000 villagers who had already been through genotyping a shortcut to acquiring some genetic information This discovery isn t a reason to go out and eat your weight in animal fat and cheese That wouldn t be recommended at all because the rest of us don t possess this genetic variant But scientists say they can use their discovery to work out which genetic variants play a role in causing complex diseases This can give clues as to why some people develop heart disease and some don t In this study using this isolated population they found a genetic variant no one had seen before and it s linked to the most common cause of death worldwide cardiovascular disease But there s still much to find out Scientists can t tell why the variant is present it could be to do with how the villagers live their lives the environment they live in or it could have been passed down the generations Very Other research teams are looking at different isolated populations such as the Amish in the United States the Inuit in northern Greenland and the Orkney Islanders in Scotland to see what else they can discover about the secrets to staying healthy", "Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this

rules which also end the sale of packets of 10 are designed to deter young people from taking up the habit Health groups have welcomed the measure as the number of smokers in the UK continues to decline But a smokers group says the changes infantilise consumers and will make no difference to public health As part of efforts to deglamorise the image of smoking the compulsory standardised green packaging must carry the new larger health warnings on two thirds of the front and back of any packet The greenish brown colour has been described by some experts as the ugliest colour in the world Similar restrictions will apply packets of rolling tobacco while e cigarettes are covered by separate regulations on packaging and warnings There will also be a ban on flavoured cigarettes and tobacco The measures were brought in last year but retailers have been given time to get rid of old stock Anti smoking campaigners have welcomed the changes with Hazel Cheeseman from Action on Smoking and Health saying that the packaging itself has been shown to be a form of advertising with the cigarette companies describing it as their silent salesman Branding and advertising is one of the things that helps to recruit young people into smoking So removing the branding features making the health warnings bigger and more prominent is intended to protect young people from taking up smoking in the future she said Two thirds of smokers start before they are 18 and Cancer Research UK also says that its evidence shows removing branding from cigarette packs will reduce their attractiveness to children Forest the smokers rights group says the new rules treat adults like naughty children and infantilise consumers Adults and even teenagers are under no illusions about the health risks of smoking says its director Simon Clark Consumers don t need larger health warnings to tell them what they already know Scotland was the first part of the UK to back the introduction of plain packaging of tobacco products The country wide move could lead to 300 000 fewer smokers in the UK over the next year a major review has suggested The Cochrane Review team led by researchers from London and Oxford estimated that the number of people who smoked in the UK could go down by 0 5 by May 2018 although they said the current evidence was limited The findings were backed up by a report from the Australian government which showed a similar drop in smoking prevalence 0 55 following the introduction of plain packaging there in 2012 Currently about 17 of the UK adult population are smokers",

consequences Everyone agrees with that In fact that was the point Margaret Sanger the birth control activist who urged scientists to develop it wanted to liberate women sexually and socially to put them on a more equal footing with men But the pill wasn t just socially revolutionary It also sparked an economic revolution perhaps the most significant economic change of the late 20th Century 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions ideas and innovations which have helped create the economic world in which we live It is broadcast on the BBC World Service You can find more information about the programme s sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast To see why first consider what the pill offered to women For a start it worked unlike many of the other options Over the centuries lovers have tried all kinds of unappealing tricks to prevent pregnancy There was crocodile dung in ancient Egypt Aristotle s recommendation of cedar oil and Casanova s method of using half a lemon as a cervical cap But even the obvious modern alternative to the pill condoms have a failure rate Because people don t tend to use them exactly as they re supposed to they sometimes rip or slip So for every 100 sexually active women using condoms for a year 18 will become pregnant The failure rate of the sponge is similar The diaphragm isn t much better But the failure rate of the pill with typical use is just 6 three times safer than condoms Used perfectly the failure rate drops to one twentieth of that Using a condom meant negotiating with a partner The diaphragm and sponge were messy But the decision to use the pill was a woman s and it was private and discreet No wonder women wanted it The pill was first approved in the United States in 1960 In just five years almost half of married women on birth control were using it But the real revolution would come when unmarried women got access to oral contraceptives That took time But in around 1970 10 years after the pill was first approved US state after US state started to make it easier for single women to get the pill Universities opened family planning centres By the mid 1970s the pill was overwhelmingly the most popular form of contraception for 18 and 19 year old women in the US And that was when the economic revolution really began Women in America started studying particular kinds of degrees law medicine dentistry and MBAs which had previously been very masculine In 1970 medical degrees were over 90 male Law degrees and MBAs were over 95 male Dentistry degrees were 99 male But at the beginning of the 1970s equipped with the pill women surged into all these courses At first women made up a fifth of the class then a quarter By 1980 they often made up a third This wasn t simply because women became more likely to go to university Women who d already decided to be students opted for these professional courses The proportion of female students studying subjects such as medicine and law rose dramatically and logically enough the presence of women in the professions rose sharply shortly afterwards But what did this have to do with the pill By giving women control over their fertility it allowed them to invest in their careers Before the pill was available taking five years or more to qualify as a doctor or lawyer didn t look like a good use of time and money To reap the benefits of those courses a woman would need to be able to reliably delay motherhood until she was 30 at least Having a baby at the wrong time risked derailing her studies or delaying her professional progress A sexually active woman who tried to become a doctor dentist or lawyer was doing the equivalent of building a factory in an earthquake zone just one bit of bad luck and the expensive investment would be trashed Of course women could simply abstain from sex if they wanted to study for a professional career But many didn t want to And it wasn t just about having fun It was also about finding a husband Before the pill people married young A woman who decided to abstain from sex while developing her career might try to find a husband at the age of 30 and find that quite literally all the good men had been taken The pill changed both those dynamics It meant that unmarried women could have sex with substantially less risk of an unwanted pregnancy But it also changed the whole pattern of marriage Everyone started to marry later even women who didn t use the pill Babies started to arrive later and at a time of women s own choosing And that meant that women at least had time to establish a professional career Of course many other things changed for American women in the 1970s Abortion was legalised laws against sex discrimination were put in place feminism emerged as a movement and the drafting of young men to fight in Vietnam forced employers to recruit more women But a careful statistical study by the Harvard economists Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz strongly suggests that the pill must have played a major role in allowing women to delay marriage and motherhood and invest in their own careers Goldin and Katz tracked the availability of the pill to young women in the US state by state They show that as each state opened up access to contraception so the enrolment rate in professional courses soared and so did women s wages Grace Hopper s compiler Computing s hidden hero How economics killed the antibiotic dream Rise of the robots What advances mean for workers Superstar economics How the gramophone changed everything A few years ago the economist Amalia Miller used a variety of clever statistical methods to demonstrate that if a woman in her 20s was able to delay motherhood by one year her lifetime earnings would rise by 10 That was some measure of the vast advantage to a woman of completing her studies and securing her career before having children But the young women of the 1970s didn t need to see Amalia Miller s research they already knew it was true As the pill became available they signed up for long professional courses in undreamt of numbers American women today can look across the Pacific Ocean for a vision of an alternative reality In Japan one of the world s most technologically advanced societies the pill wasn t approved for use until 1999 Japanese women had to wait 39 years longer than their American counterparts for the same contraceptive In contrast when the erection boosting drug Viagra was approved in the US Japan was just a few months behind Gender inequality in Japan is widely reckoned to be worse than anywhere else in the developed world with women continuing to struggle for recognition in the workplace It is impossible to disentangle cause and effect here but the experience in the US suggests that it is no coincidence Delay the pill by two generations and of course the economic impact on women will be enormous It is a tiny little pill that continues to transform the world economy

is also likely to add about another 30m and logistical costs could add more Labour has promised to make car parking at NHS hospitals in England free if it wins the election Hospital car parking fees were abolished in Scotland and Wales in 2008 although a small number of hospitals still charge as they remain tied in to contracts with private companies that manage their parking facilities Fees may be charged in Northern Ireland In England whether to charge fees is a decision for individual trusts with some making parking free for particular patients such as cancer patients or those using dialysis or for parents staying overnight with their children Jeremy Corbyn told BBC News This would cost 162m Going to a hospital shouldn t incur an additional charge In reality it s a charge on sickness That figure is based on Freedom of Information requests made by the Press Association at the end of last year Responses from 89 of the 120 NHS trusts in England showed they had made 120 662 650 in parking fees in the financial year 2015 16 Labour has assumed that the remaining trusts would have had the same average parking fees as those that responded and extrapolated to reach the figure of 162m That is not statistical best practice especially because some of the bigger trusts such as the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust did not supply 2015 16 figures The previous year that trust alone made 3 728 000 in parking charges so the overall figure for England could be considerably higher Even though fees generally aren t charged in Scotland and Wales if extra money is to be spent on car parking at hospitals in England then money will also have to go to the other nations under the Barnett formula which Labour says would take the bill up to 190m There could be additional charges on top of that as hospitals that currently contract out their car parking would have to maintain their own car parks and find a way to patrol them to ensure that hospital car parks weren t being filled up by people who were not using the hospital By the standards of health spending 162m is pretty cheap approximately equal to the amount it costs to run the NHS in England for 12 hours Nonetheless it is a big issue for patients and visitors who have to pay to park at hospitals NHS Digital releases average parking costs at hospitals although not the overall amounts raised A small number of hospitals charge as much as 3 an hour for parking There was also a report from the RAC that criticised hospital parking in England for being unreasonably stressful It said too many car parks made users decide in advance how long they would need to park for so that they often either overpaid or had to leave appointments to put more money in the meter Labour also highlighted some NHS

this we have a very much underutilised tool food In BBC One s Doctor in the House I try to help 34 year old Emma Gleeson who has been experiencing anxiety depression and panic attacks for many years She was 19 when she really began struggling with mental health Following a severe episode of pneumonia she ended up in intensive care in a coma When she woke up she was petrified She developed an extreme fear of death and this can precipitate her panic attacks During an attack Emma feels terrified and can often scream out loud It is extremely worrying for her family and can be scary to onlookers Emma has tried various medications and counselling therapies but was still struggling and getting three to four panic attacks per day One of the ways in which I helped her was by changing her food choices Despite being sceptical at first I was able to show Emma the hidden power of food in helping her mental state I had been living on a diet of takeaways fizzy drinks and general processed and convenience foods for as long as I can remember and didn t for one moment think that what I ate was contributing in any way to the anxiety and panic attacks I d been experiencing for years she said Since meeting and spending time with Dr Rangan he has changed my entire outlook on food and why certain foods were potentially having a negative impact on my mental health I now only buy and cook with fresh food I make my own stocks I eat plenty of fish and I try to reduce the amount of sugar I consume I feel so much better and intend to keep this up The evidence of food s link to mental states has been growing A landmark 2015 article in the prestigious Lancet journal stated that nutrition may be as important to mental health as it is to cardiology endocrinology and gastroenterology Plus a small but important interventional Australian study from earlier this year showed that a modified Mediterranean diet significantly helped many patients with severe depression within 12 weeks Unfortunately this has not translated into routine patient care and most doctors still do not discuss food with their mental health patients This has to change Many of us do not think about how food can impact the way we feel but we all know the feeling of using food as a quick pick me up When we are feeling a little tired a little stressed or a little low we often reach for a sugary snack to help us feel good in the short term But this can actually make things worse in the long term The food you are eating is literally shocking your body By changing her diet as well as reducing her alcohol intake Emma experienced a reduction in anxiety an improvement in mood and fewer panic attacks She also described feeling mentally stronger having a clearer head more energy and a greater ability to cope with stress It has also encouraged her to be more active and do more things at weekends which also helps her mental health Of course there can be many other factors to consider with mental health problems and it is always worth getting advice from a qualified healthcare professional There can be many other important factors to consider with mental health problems such as emotional trauma and stress but we should not underestimate the power of changing our food to improve our mood As a doctor I like to empower my patients Here are four of the tips that helped Emma that can also help you 1 Reduce sugar and processed foods Sugar food that contains sugar or even food that is converted quickly into sugar such as many breakfast cereals cause your blood sugar to rapidly rise Within two to three hours your sugar levels then start to fall At this point you may not only feel hungry you can feel h angry as well hungry and angry Low and falling blood sugar levels can cause a rise in your body s stress hormones cortisol and adrenaline This can have a negative impact on your mood 2 Increase your intake of Omega 3 fats This is an essential nutrient for brain function and may protect against anxiety and other psychiatric disorders Foods high in Omega 3 fats include fatty fish salmon mackerel anchovies grass fed meat seeds and leafy vegetables 3 Eat more tryptophan containing foods like pork chicken seeds and walnuts Tryptophan is an amino acid the body converts into serotonin your feel good neurotransmitter Eat them with a healthy carbohydrate source such as sweet potatoes which helps to transport more tryptophan into your blood 4 Feed your gut bugs Some scientists refer to the trillions of gut bugs that live inside us the gut microbiota as the brain s peacekeepers It is thought that having a healthy population of gut bugs can have a significant influence on your mood via the gut brain axis The prebiotic fibre contained in vegetables help your gut bugs to proliferate so the best way to maintain a healthy population is to increase your intake of vegetables as well as fermented foods such as sauerkraut Best options are leeks onions garlic artichokes and cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower You have the ability to improve the way you feel by controlling what you put on your plate See how food can impact mental health on

economy is estimated to be around 12bn per year plus there are huge personal and emotional costs In BBC One s Doctor in the House I help 42 year old Mark who works in retail A former athlete Mark has suffered from back pain for over 20 years and this has caused him significant problems Most cases of back pain are self limiting and probably go within a few weeks Mark was different He had chronic back pain and this had lasted for years He has had to take time off from work which has impacted his family s financial situation and he s even had to stay in hospital because his pain has been so severe It is always important to rule out specific causes such as cancer infections and fractures so seek advice from a medical professional if you re concerned Thankfully the vast majority of back pain cases have no sinister cause and are called non specific and there are a wide variety of therapies that can be useful The National Institute for health and Care Excellence NICE guidelines encourage sufferers to continue with normal activities as much as possible Unfortunately for Mark this was not possible He used to do mixed martial arts classes every week with his son Kiki but had to give this up because of his pain This was upsetting for them both After spending time with Mark I identified some key areas that I felt were playing a role in his back pain mechanical psychological and biochemical My treatment plan involved tackling them all Movement specialist I first examined Mark s feet and noticed they were not symmetrical this is like a building with a wonky foundation I knew that this was likely to be a contributing factor to Mark s back pain so I took him to see a movement specialist He looked at Mark s full history Mark had an injury to his right knee and had broken his leg when he was five years old Both these factors may have contributed to Mark s back pain The therapist assessed Mark s movement patterns and identified muscles that were not working as efficiently as they should He also assessed Mark s stability and flexibility He identified a reduced range of motion in his right leg and overuse of his left He recommended a series of movements for Mark to perform several times per week These were personalised for Mark He said Just by speaking to a movement specialist and them looking at the way I walked they could tell that it was my left side that was overcompensating for my right Doctors and specialists I d seen in the past hadn t recognised this and it was only Dr Chatterjee s completely different approach that flagged this as one of the possible reasons for my back pain Seeing the movement specialist has definitely helped and what I ve realised from this process is that there are other ways of improving your health and any conditions you have if you know how Tai Chi In addition Mark suffered from huge amounts of stress Financial worries concerns over employment and resultant insomnia meant that Mark was carrying a lot of stress around with him Stress can modify our perception of pain through its action on the brain To combat Mark s stress I taught him various ways in which he could actively de stress such as making time for himself listening to music and meditation In addition I sent him to try Tai Chi Mark already had a love of martial arts so I felt it would be an activity he d enjoy Tai Chi is a low impact form of exercise known as a moving meditation and combines slow purposeful movements with controlled breathing Vitamin D Mark had very low levels of Vitamin D which is an important nutrient for bone health Our main source is from the action of sunlight on our skin although we can get some from foods such as oily fish and eggs Many of us struggle to get enough from food and require supplementation People with dark skin are at higher risk of being low in Vitamin D Mark felt a reduction in pain once I corrected his Vitamin D levels I have many patients who have seen similar improvements A combination approach The 2016 NICE guidance on the management of back pain recognises that a combination of approaches may be necessary to treat back pain exercise psychological therapies as well as manipulative therapy In my 15 years of clinical experience I have found that different patients have different triggers Therefore it stands to reason that the success of a treatment regime may vary from person to person I used a combination of approaches with Mark Within a few weeks he was back doing mixed martial arts classes with his son Two months later he was riding his bike and using a cross trainer for 30 minutes every day The bane of back pain The key to managing back pain is to understand what the causes are for you I suffered with back pain for 10 years and tried many different therapies that would give me short term relief It was only when I saw movement specialist Gary Ward who featured in Doctor in the House series 1 that my pain went away for good He helped me to re train my movement patterns Here are some simple tips that may help you with your back pain 1 Get up regularly from your desk Set an alarm once every hour to remind you to get up and move around Perhaps try a standing desk a different chair or even a Swiss ball 2 Prioritise active relaxation This could be meditation yoga or simply going for a walk 3 Find a regular form of activity that you enjoy You are much more likely to engage with an activity long term if you enjoy it I suggested Tai Chi to Mark because he loved martial arts 4 Try and be as active as possible Don t underestimate the benefits of regular

new window Nepalese Sherpas have a physiology that uses oxygen more efficiently than those used to the atmosphere at sea level This is the finding of a new study that investigated high altitude adaptation in mountain populations The research involved taking muscle samples from mountaineers at 5 300m altitude and even putting them on an exercise bike at Mt Everest Base Camp The Sherpas owe this ability to an advantageous genetic mutation that gives them a unique metabolism It has long been a puzzle that Sherpas can cope with the low oxygen atmosphere present high in the Himalayas far better than those visiting the region Mountaineers trekking to the area can adapt to the low oxygen by increasing the number of red cells in their blood increasing its oxygen carrying capacity In contrast Sherpas actually have thinner blood with less haemoglobin and a reduced capacity for oxygen although this does have the advantage that the blood flows more easily and puts less strain on the heart This shows that it s not how much oxygen you ve got it s what you do with it that counts concludes Cambridge University s Prof Andrew Murray the senior author on the new study Sherpas are extraordinary performers especially on the high Himalayan peaks So there s something really unusual about their physiology he told the BBC World Service s Science In Action programme Unravelling what is different involved a substantial scientific expedition to Everest Base Camp where the high altitude response of 10 mostly European researchers and 15 elite Sherpas could be compared For participants like James Horscroft whose PhD was based on the data he got from this Xtreme Everest 2 venture this meant not just a chance to explore one of the planet s most remote regions but also a lot of pressure It was very stressful because we only had this one chance to get our data high in the Himalaya For James like all the others those data included samples of muscle punctured from the thigh While some samples were frozen to be taken back to university labs others were experimented on in a makeshift lab at the base camp We had to start at seven in the morning because it took four hours to do all the tests on one sample James said At that time the temperature could be 10 degrees below freezing so we d be all wrapped up and wearing gloves By late morning it would rise to plus 25 and we d be taking all our kit off What the biochemical tests on the fresh muscle showed was that the Sherpas tissue was able to make much better use of oxygen by limiting the amount of body fat burned and maximising the glucose consumption Fat is a great fuel but the problem is that it s more oxygen hungry than glucose Prof Murray explained In other words by preferentially burning body sugar rather than body fat the Sherpas can get more calories per unit of oxygen breathed The result impresses Federico Formenti of King s College London whose own trekking study a decade ago monitoring oxygen consumption through breath sensors suggested Sherpas can produce 30 more power than lowlanders This paper provides a cellular mechanism for what we found at the whole body level that Sherpas use less oxygen to do the same job he says James Horscroft agrees the difference in performance is impressive It was pretty clear straight away that our tissue experiments were showing different metabolisms for the two groups In fact the difference was so astounding we were worried if the tests were working But back in Cambridge the results were borne out And a genetic variation altering the way fats are burned was established too While all of the Sherpas carried the glucose favouring variant of the metabolic gene almost none of the lowland volunteers did Sherpas are a specific population amongst the Nepalese the Ferraris of the Himalayans Formenti calls them who migrated to the country 500 years ago from Tibet which has been occupied by humans for at least 6 000 years That is plenty of time for a beneficial gene to become embedded Prof Murray argues It s not down to one gene of course We see better blood flow through the capillaries and they appear to have a richer capillary network as well so that the oxygen can be delivered better to the tissues But this gene would also have given them some advantage Other recent studies have shown that some genes that help Tibetans survive at high altitude come from the recently discovered extinct human species known as the Denisovans although there is no evidence yet that the metabolic gene is among them The Sherpa study is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences You can hear an interview with Prof Murray on this week s Science In Action programme to be broadcast first on Thursday", "Share this

countries as a treatment for children who exhibit severe self injuring behaviour Seventeen year old Jonah Lutz is severely autistic He s also prone to outbursts of violent behaviour in which he sometimes hits himself repeatedly His mother Amy is convinced that if it wasn t for electroconvulsive therapy ECT he would now have to be permanently institutionalised for his own safety and the safety of those around him The use of ECT featured famously in the 1975 Hollywood movie One Flew Over the Cuckoo s Nest starring Jack Nicholson Set in a mental institution the Oscar winning film cemented most people s view of ECT as barbaric But Amy describes the modern version of the therapy as little short of miraculous ECT has been transformative for Jonah s life and for our life she says We went for a period of time for years and years where Jonah was raging often multiple times a day ferociously The only reason he s able to be at home with us is because of ECT It s estimated that one in 10 severely autistic children like Jonah violently attack themselves often causing serious injuries ranging from broken noses to detached retinas No one really knows why Some theories link self injuring behaviour to anxiety caused by an overload of sensory signals others to frustration as the autistic child struggles to communicate Amy and husband Andy tried countless traditional treatments using medication or behavioural therapy before finally turning to ECT a treatment that first began to be used on children like Jonah a decade ago in parts of the US Each session alleviates his symptoms for up to 10 days at a time but it s not a cure Jonah s doctor Charles Kellner ECT director at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York is so convinced it s effective and safe that he allows Amy to witness the procedure and the BBC to film it Prof Kellner says the best way to overcome the negative image of ECT portrayed in popular culture is to show people what modern ECT is really like and show them the results with patients like Jonah Jonah is one of a few hundred children in the US to receive the controversial treatment He has had about 260 ECT sessions since the age of 11 There s a lot of interesting new neural imaging research showing that ECT actually reverses some of the brain problems in the major psychiatric illnesses Kellner explains as he makes final checks on the wiring around Jonah s temples We don t know exactly why it works in people with autism and superimposed mood disorders but we think it probably reregulates the circuits in the brain that are deregulated because of autism The modern treatment is carried out under general anaesthetic with muscle relaxants to prevent violent convulsions At the flick of a switch Kellner administers just under an amp of electric current in a series of very short pulses Jonah s body begins to shake as the current induces a seizure ECT specialists think this may reset the malfunctioning brain The convulsions last for about 30

exhibiting self injuring behaviour are unknown in some countries and in a handful of US states the treatment is not allowed The UK s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence doesn t recommend ECT for use on under 18s But ECT is a well established treatment in adults for severe often life threatening depression Its use is controversial though with memory loss the main acknowledged side effect What s disputed is the scale of the memory loss Studies carried out by ECT doctors suggest lapses are mostly short term and that memory function soon returns to normal But opponents of ECT cite surveys claiming to show that more than half of patients suffer serious long term memory loss It s a traumatic brain injury says Dr Peter Breggin a psychiatrist who has long fought the psychiatric establishment and campaigns for a total ban on ECT The electricity not only travels through the frontal lobes that s the seat of intelligence and thoughtfulness and creativity and judgment it also goes through the temporal lobes the seat of memory You are damaging the very expression of the personality the character the individuality and even if you believe in it the expression of the soul For former US Army intelligence officer Chad Calvaresi and his wife Kaci the potential benefits of ECT far outweigh the risks for their 11 year old violently autistic daughter Sofija When she was aggressing towards me my instinct as a mom was to grab her and hold her and hug her and wait Kaci explains But she got so big and strong that I couldn t do that Sofija spent much of her early life suffering neglect and abuse in a Serbian orphanage before Chad and Kaci adopted her in 2009 They were determined to give her a better life in America but in 2016 they suffered the heartbreak of institutionalising her again this time for her own safety She beat herself so bad her nose was busted and bleeding her lips were busted open and bleeding Chad explains She gave herself a black eye I was scared of my own daughter For six months Sofija received medication and therapy as an in patient at the renowned Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore but there was little improvement During her frequent violent episodes it often took three highly trained care staff all wearing protective clothing and shielding Sofija with padded mats to prevent her injuring herself or others After exhausting all other options Sofija s doctors finally agreed to Chad and Kaci s request to give her ECT Just a month later her behaviour had improved enough for her to return home We caught up with the family after six months and more than 30 treatments and the transformation was remarkable Sofija was swimming in the family pool and playing with her siblings and while her violent episodes hadn t disappeared completely her parents felt they were less intense and more manageable Sofija was also receiving home schooling in maths and English She s sharp as a tack says Kaci The only memory loss that Sofija has had from ECT is she forgets the procedure has actually happened ECT for severely self injuring autistic children like Sofija is still in very limited use and without a long term scientific study it remains highly controversial But even though Sofija is likely to need ECT every week for the foreseeable future her parents have no regrets they have their daughter back home It s overwhelming if I think about it says Kaci but what future did she have without it My hope is she doesn t need it for the rest of her life but at this point I see it like a diabetic needing insulin It keeps her alive Literally it keeps her alive and it makes it possible for us to be able to have her in our home living life with our family and enjoying Sofija For and against ECT The Royal College of Psychiatrists says ECT is a safe and effective treatment for severe depression in adults but acknowledges on its website that some dispute this For Many doctors and nurses will say that they have seen ECT relieve very severe depressive illnesses when other treatments have failed Bearing in mind that 15 of people with severe depression will kill themselves they feel that ECT has saved patients lives and therefore the overall benefits are greater than the risks Some people who have had ECT will agree and may even ask for it if they find themselves becoming depressed again Against Some see ECT as a treatment that belongs to the past They say that the side effects are severe and that psychiatrists have either accidentally or deliberately ignored how severe they can be They say that ECT permanently damages both the brain and the mind and if it does work at all does so in a way that is ultimately harmful for the patient Some would want to see it banned You can watch the Our World

energy proton beam machine has been delivered to its new home in Newport Proton Partners International PPI received the part that will fire the cancer treating beam at its Rutherford Cancer Centre PPI said the UK s most advanced piece of cancer machinery could transform treatment for 500 patients a year Currently only low energy treatment is available in the UK for rare eye cancers The Welsh Government said proton beam therapy will be available at the centre to NHS Wales patients with certain cancers within the next year PPI chief executive Mike Moran said it was the most strategic health project in this country in decades It s significant for the people of Wales to have high energy proton beam therapy available he added He said the treatment would certainly improve clinical outcomes and the experience for patients who up to now have had to spend up to six weeks abroad to get proton beam therapy The use of proton therapy was highlighted by the case of five year old Ashya King whose parents took him to the Czech Republic for treatment for a brain tumour three years ago After its installation the machine will be up and running next year PPI said treatment at the centre will be available to medically insured private patients self paying patients and patients referred by the NHS Analysis by BBC Wales health correspondent Owain Clarke This is certainly a coup for those trying to make Wales a hub for health innovation and research But it is unclear how many of the 500 patients a year expected to be treated at the privately run centre will be from the Welsh NHS That is because the NHS in England is currently building two similar proton beam centres in house Located at established hospitals in London and Manchester some argue they d be better placed to provide more comprehensive wrap around care than would be possible at a stand alone centre Discussions between the company the Welsh Government and Welsh NHS I m told are well advanced but whatever the outcome of those as the first centre of its type in the UK this is certainly a significant development Proton beam therapy is a highly targeted type of radiotherapy which can treat hard to reach cancers such as spinal tumours with a lower risk of damaging the surrounding tissue and causing side effects About 140 patients a year are sent abroad from across the NHS mostly to the US and Switzerland at a cost of around 114 000 each Experts have said the proton beam clinic in Newport could halve that cost while also allowing patients to remain close to their families while receiving treatment The Rutherford Cancer Centre opened in February and receives referrals for conventional cancer treatments PPI is building three more proton beam centres in the UK in Northumberland Reading and Liverpool The firm has received 10m from the Welsh Government s Wales Life Sciences Investment Fund", "Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy

with the Department of Health but this had not been done when the election for 8 June was called We sought advice and clarification in the hope that a date for publication could be agreed but it was clear after discussions with the department that this would not be permitted without breaching Cabinet Office guidance It is disappointing but the financial results for the provider sector will have to be published after the general election The financial state of the NHS in England has been debated intensely In the 2015 16 financial year hospitals and other trusts ran up deficits totalling 2 4bn The latest figures covering the three months until the end of March will confirm the deficits for the most recent financial year 2016 17 They are usually published ahead of NHS Improvement board meetings with the next one due before the end of May It is understood that NHS Improvement wants to publish the figures in line with normal practice which should be within the next week But Whitehall officials have advised that because of so called purdah rules there should be a delay until after polling day The purdah convention limits civil service announcements during election campaigns Some

breaking point Delaying the release of the figures won t magically solve the very real problems our health service is facing Dr Mark Holland president of the Society for Acute Medicine said The

their vote NHS England caused some raised eyebrows at the start of the campaign by announcing that the monthly performance figures including A E waiting times due on 8 June would not go out then

Media Centre have written to the head of the civil service Sir Jeremy Heywood calling for clarification of the purdah rules The signatories said that the public are being denied access to the best

west London The idea of restricting an autism diagnosis to only the most severe cases was discussed earlier this month The local alliance of five clinical commissioning groups CCGs says nothing has been decided yet But the National Autistic Society says it is deeply concerned about the plans Board papers from a meeting of south west London and St George s mental health trust a fortnight ago describe a service under intense pressure with waiting times for autism diagnoses of more than 10 months The team is supposed to carry out 750 assessments a year But it is getting almost double that level of demand with about 25 referrals a week The papers state that NHS commissioners who fund services have asked the trust to review who is eligible for the service so they focus specifically on children who have another condition such as depression The report goes on to say The effect of reviewing and revising the criteria must be to reduce the number of children and young people who are able to access a full diagnostic assessment from the trust The National Autistic Society has written in protest to the local CCGs covering Kingston Merton Richmond Wandsworth and Sutton The charity s head of policy Sarah Lambert said If it goes ahead this will leave many local children without access to a diagnosis and unable to access the specialist support they desperately need That will threaten their long term prospects and put a greater strain on many already vulnerable families We believe this goes against CCGs legal duty to make sure children in their area can access a diagnosis service An autism diagnosis can be life changing It can explain years of feeling different and help unlock crucial advice and support The charity has written to commissioners to express its concerns and to offer to help them make sure that this service remains available It ran a national campaign two years ago highlighting the difficulties and long waits autistic people and families face in many areas in getting a diagnosis SEND Family Voices the parent carer forum in Kingston and Richmond said The sense is that these proposals have been agreed without due consultation with any of the stakeholders and more importantly without consideration of the impact upon families children and young people The five CCGs said No decision has been made by the Trust or by the commissioning CCGs on taking this approach forward We absolutely recognise the concerns of families of children with a neuro developmental condition and the groups who support them Any potential changes to the service would require detailed engagement with stakeholders The CCGs are fully committed to talking to local people before reaching any conclusions on the way forward We want to be clear that nothing has been

These are external links and will open in a new window There s another big election coming up which will have an impact on hundreds of millions of people all around world but you probably haven t heard anything about it Health ministers and officials from 194 countries are due to vote for a new director general of the World Health Organization in Geneva on Tuesday The UN agency founded in 1948 describes itself as the global guardian of public health but it lost a great deal of credibility and trust over its handling of the Ebola crisis in 2014 The new boss could make or break the WHO which is still trying to prove it is fit for purpose after admitting it was slow to respond to what became the worst Ebola outbreak in history However dealing with epidemics is just part of what WHO does Its stated goal is to ensure the highest attainable level of health for all people In practice that means everything from trying to wipe out deadly diseases for good to trying to deal with the growing number of obesity and diabetes epidemics to reducing deaths on the roads and saving the lives of mothers and babies during childbirth Heading an organisation responsible for the health of all 7 3 billion people on earth is no small task The word health itself is a burden that it carries said Devi Sridhar professor of global public health at the University of Edinburgh Improving health worldwide can mean so many things from mental health to malaria to unintentional injuries to cancer It s very hard for one agency with a very limited and very constrained budget of around 2bn every year to achieve all those things Prof Sridhar who has recently written a book looking at WHO funding said the US s health protection agency the CDC has a budget more than three times that of the WHO She also said most of it comes from donors who earmark their funding for specific projects Only around 20 of the WHO budget comes from compulsory contributions from member states she said Whoever gets the top job will have to be the consummate politician They will have to get country leaders on board with big often expensive global health objectives while also being above politics and not beholden to the special interests of any particular country There have been two types of leader at the WHO in the past said Prof David Heymann a former assistant director at the WHO Some have tried to build consensus between 194 member countries then try to implement what those countries have said Others have been leaders who have been out in front with a vision and tried to pull 194 countries along with that vision There are three candidates left in the running for the 241 000 a year job The vote will take place at the annual World Health Assembly in Geneva Whoever is elected will serve a minimum five year term I was born into a poor family When I was seven I lost my younger brother probably to measles I survived by chance but it could have been me For me this position is about standing up for the rights of the poor If I became director general I would be very vocal on the issue of universal healthcare We complain about emergencies or epidemics worried it may come to our country But if we ensure universal health coverage we can resolve all of those issues Inequity is a central challenge The world has all the resources to save every life as long as we believe every life is important Those who have do not care for the have nots and unless we confront that reality honestly I don t think we will make progress I was born and brought up in Peshawar on the Afghan border in Pakistan I was raised in a progressive family My father encouraged us to swim in the summer and play golf I was a local golf champion by the time I was 16 When I was 15 my father passed away silently in his sleep I think that was a turning point in my life I trained as a cardiologist and I became very disillusioned with the disparity of care between the rich and the poor My vision for this role centres on regaining the WHO s primacy and ensuring that it has the world s trust as its lead health agency Since the Ebola outbreak the WHO has come under heavy criticism for its inability to exercise stewardship during health emergencies I want to make the organisation more accountable and transparent I want it to focus on its core roles rather than doing everything under the sun in a half baked way I would lead the WHO very differently My parents are both doctors and probably because of their influence I started working outside the UK It was when I was working in Nepal in 1989 that I found how malnutrition and disease were most likely to come from households that faced particularly difficult circumstances in terms of income the status of women and their access to sanitation and water It seemed to me blindingly obvious that I had to work on the underlying determinants of health My first priority if I become director general of the WHO is to focus on universal health coverage everybody being able to access healthcare when and where they need it My second priority is to make sure people can be defended against outbreaks of disease Thirdly we are seeing increasing levels of diabetes

the BBC nothing has changed and said rival parties had been trying to scare elderly people It came after she said earlier that there would be a cap on how much people paid for care a change from the original policy which included no cap She did not say what level the cap would be set at but said it would be in a post election consultation Labour and the Lib Dems said the Conservative social care policy was in meltdown Since the publication of the Conservative manifesto last week much attention has been focused on reforms to the way care for elderly and vulnerable adults is funded The manifesto did not mention an overall cap on costs instead proposing a 100 000 floor beyond which people s assets would be protected Speaking to activists in Wales earlier Mrs May said the package would now include an absolute limit on the money people would have to pay triggering accusations that she had made a U turn In her interview with the BBC s Andrew Neil Mrs May denied this and said the principle the policy was based on remained absolutely the same Analysis By BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg Suddenly only four days after the Tory manifesto was published Theresa May has added one rather crucial proposal to her social care plan a limit or a cap to the amount of money one individual could be asked to pay She is adamant that she is not budging on her principles and was clearly irritated by questions after her speech that said she was backtracking But the manifesto did not include the notion of a cap and just yesterday ministers publicly rejected such an idea Read more from Laura The whole package will be put out to consultation Mrs May said adding that people had been worried by the Labour Party saying her reforms could mean they would have to sell their homes to pay for care Including an overall cap would mean the Tories were protecting people for the future Mrs May said We are providing a system that provides sustainability in our social care for the future and we have got an ageing population We need to do this otherwise our system will collapse Since the manifesto launch on Thursday ministers had been saying the idea of a cap as proposed by a government review in 2011 had been rejected Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said at the time that it was completely explicit that the idea of a cap had been dropped Currently anyone with savings and other assets worth more than 23 250 is expected to pay the full cost of their residential care and the value of their home can be taken into account But this does not apply to those receiving care in their own home Under the Conservative plans this would change and the value of a person s homes could in future be factored in However the money would not be taken until after the person or their surviving partner had died and 100 000 from that estate would be protected Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mrs May s announcement was a triumph of spin over reality and the policy had changed very little Former Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said Theresa May had suffered a manifesto meltdown but had still not provided certainty to families about how much they would have to pay for domiciliary care In the interview with Andrew Neil Mrs May also said her cabinet backed her pledge to cut immigration below 100 000 contrary to the claims of ex chancellor George Osborne and that a strong economy would help fund the Tories 8bn NHS pledge She also said an extra 10bn would be spent on NHS buildings and infrastructure as recommended in a recent government review with the money to be raised from a variety of sources The PM refused to rule out future rises to National Insurance contributions for the self employed but said the issue was off the table and that it was her party s intention to

BBC investigation found thousands of Kettering General Hospital patients had waited a year or more for operations David Phelan a hospital trust governor claims patients were removed from lists because national targets were being missed The hospital admitted there had been anomalies and that a thorough review of data had been carried out A hospital review has found that 138 patients were harmed including one who had substantial sight loss as a result of the long waits Mr Phelan who raised concerns under whistleblowing procedures was working as associate general manager in the trauma and orthopaedics department when he discovered discrepancies in the referral to treatment time RTT data in October 2015 He warned managers that the daily RTT report was understating the true position by half when checked against patient records He told the BBC he discovered managers at Kettering General Hospital had used six exclusion categories to remove patients from their official waiting list data It became apparent to me that a systematic fiddling of the waiting list figures was taking place he said I made a whistle blowing submission about this I have been stonewalled about this for two years He says the trust manipulated the figures to avoid being fined for patients waiting longer than 52 weeks The NHS regulator fines for breaches of waiting times are per patient House sale consultant Andy Hames is one of the forgotten patients The 45 year old from Corby had been suffering from a painful prostate complaint I went for my pre operation at Kettering General Hospital I was told then the operation would be performed within two weeks Two weeks passed and no notice of the operation I waited and waited and still no joy By that time a year had passed I went to my GP who made a complaint They chased it up for me and the operation was carried out a couple of weeks after During that year I was suffering discomfort It was hard to urinate Mr Hames who has since made a recovery said he was never told he had been dropped from the list but is now angry that he was forced to suffer so long An inspection report by the Care Quality Commission said when these data problems were identified the number of patients found to be waiting more than 52 weeks leapt from just eight to 25 000 The hospital which has a deficit of 25m has spent more than 3m trawling a million records to try to find the true number of people waiting for treatment The hospital trust was put into special measures last month by the regulator as it tries to clear the backlog Waiting times for hospitals are heavily regulated and for good reason The sooner a patient is seen by a consultant the easier it is to nip a problem in the bud At one time hospital trusts were fined for every patient who waited too long In Kettering s case this would have added up to many millions of pounds money they could not afford to lose at a time when deficits were starting to fall into the red Accurate computer data is vital not just for the regulators but for the trusts themselves who need to monitor their own progress and spending Many of the patients left waiting were elderly and many didn t complain It is a feature of our investigations that in the cases we found the patients only got their operations after complaining on social media or to their GPs or MPs Whatever the reason it is astonishing that so many were apparently lost in the system A hospital spokesman said We suspended reporting of our waiting list data to the Department of Health in December 2015 when we became aware of some anomalies which suggested there could be some issues with our systems In March 2017 we returned to reporting our waiting list data This means we are confident we have now addressed our data quality and system issues and that our waiting list data is reliable Kettering General Hospital s chief operating officer Rebecca Brown said I want to reassure our patients that throughout this period in the vast majority of cases patients treatment pathways have progressed as normal However the intensive review of our waiting list data and systems has found as of May 21st 2017 282 patients who have waited more than a year 52 weeks to be seen This is unacceptable and we profoundly regret that these cases were not seen appropriately much earlier"]
