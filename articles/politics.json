after 9 June In a speech in Glasgow Mr Corbyn attacked what he said was the SNP s obsession with an unwanted and unnecessary second independence referendum In her BBC interview Ms Sturgeon said the Labour leader was not credible as an alternative prime minister Asked whether her party would back Labour in key Budget votes if there was a hung Parliament she said We will work for progressive policies and we will work for the policies we put forward in our manifesto If there was a hung Parliament she said of course we would look to be part of a progressive alliance that pursued progressive policies but predicted this would not be the outcome despite polls showing a narrowing of the Tories lead Voting Labour in Scotland risks letting the Tories in she said Ms Sturgeon said she did not agree with Mr Corbyn s plans to raise corporation tax a key source of funding for Labour s manifesto pledges And asked about her predecessor Alex Salmond s claim that Labour was copying key SNP policies she added Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery The SNP launches its manifesto on Tuesday and Ms Sturgeon promised to get Scotland s voice heard She gave what she described as a clear hint on public sector pay which is currently subject to a cap saying future settlements should recognise the cost of living pressures that public sector workers are having to live under The Scottish government s public sector workers are currently restricted to an average 1 pay rise in line with the rest of the UK although it has offered extra help for the lowest paid Ms Sturgeon was also quizzed

market membership Labour s shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner rejected the idea of a progressive alliance telling BBC Radio 4 s Westminster Hour If Labour were to be the largest single party then the honourable thing to do in my view is to govern as a minority government He said other parties would then be challenged to back Labour s progressive policies by voting for them

is the Greens first and so far only MP and after seven years in the Commons she is the face of the party for many voters She was its first leader elected in 2008 when the party abandoned its long standing practice of having a male and a female principal speaker She stepped aside in 2012 some said to concentrate on shoring up support in her constituency although she insisted it was to give other people the opportunity to get well known to have some profile in the party hopefully to use that to get themselves elected as well She was replaced by Natalie Bennett but the new leader failed to be elected to the Commons in 2015 despite boosting her profile by participating in the leaders debates at the last election Ms Lucas was re elected to the Brighton Pavilion seat she took from Labour in 2010 with an increased majority of nearly 8 000 The 56 year old who was an academic before entering politics and has also served as a Green MEP has established herself as a respected voice at Westminster The Spectator magazine named her newcomer of the year in 2010 She opposed the so called bedroom tax the benefits cap the renewal of Trident and the Sun s Page Three while she hit the headlines in 2013 for different reasons when she was arrested during an anti fracking demonstration One of three children of middle class Conservative voting parents she attended an all girls boarding school before earning a degree in English Literature at Exeter University She threw herself into anti nuclear weapons campaigns at university frequently visiting the Greenham Common women s peace camp and she remains a leading figure in the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and a former vice president of the Stop the War Coalition Ms Lucas is a leading advocate of the so called Progressive Alliance a series of electoral pacts between left leaning parties aimed at preventing the Conservatives from winning seats In her own seat she will benefit from a deal with the Lib Dems who will stand aside to give her a better chance of being re elected The Greens will not field a candidate in neighbouring Brighton Kemptown to support the Labour candidate and some other agreements have been struck around the country But she has expressed frustration at the refusal of Labour and Lib Dem leaders to endorse the idea nationally saying it is the only way to combat what she says is the UK s broken electoral system and fight back against the hard Brexit she says Theresa May is plotting Like the Lib Dems the Greens support a second referendum on the terms of any Brexit deal Ms Lucas is married with two children Under her job sharing arrangement with Mr Bartley she leads the party s parliamentary and campaigning efforts in areas such as fracking and the EU while Mr Bartley focuses more on organisation and policy Jonathan Bartley is a relative newcomer to Green Party politics compared with Ms Lucas Active in the Green Party in south London for about five years the 45 year old stood for the party in the London Assembly elections but failed to win a seat A year before that he stood as a general election candidate in Streatham coming fourth He studied at the London School of Economics in the early 1990s and is reported to have worked as volunteer for John Major in 1995 when the then prime minister faced a challenge to his leadership from John Redwood He founded the think tank Ekklesia in 2002 only standing down as a director earlier this year and became a commentator on issues of faith religion and public policy First rising to national attention as vice chairman of the Yes to Fairer Votes Campaign during the 2011 referendum he helped ensure the Greens were a prominent voice He was a spokesman for the organisation in its ill fated effort to persuade the public to ditch the current first past the post electoral system in favour of the alternative vote But he is perhaps best known for his public confrontation with David Cameron during the 2010 general election campaign during which he raised his concerns about the treatment of disabled children in the education system Mr Bartley told the then prime minister about the two year struggle he had faced to get his son Samuel into a local school and remonstrated with Mr Cameron about plans to end the bias towards inclusion of children with special needs in mainstream schools Mr Bartley who is separated from his wife and has three children is a direct descendant of the prison reformer Elizabeth Fry and is a drummer for the Mustangs blues group In March he admitted in an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live that he killed a student in a car crash when he was 17 years old The accident happened while he was on his way home from a concert in London The police did not press charges after an investigation Mr Bartley who apologised to the victim s family after attending an inquest which recorded a verdict of accidental death said he felt so responsible so guilty about what had happened and that it had turned his life upside down But he added that it was also one of the reasons he wanted to bring about policy changes to improve road safety and reduce the 40 000 deaths he said occurred every year

election and by how much Check what the latest opinion polls say and follow updates from the BBC s senior elections and political analyst Peter Barnes The poll tracker will be updated as the campaign unfolds Please enable Javascript to view our poll tracker Five polls have been published this evening Overall they reinforce Thursday night s polls which suggested that the Conservative lead over Labour has shrunk again since last weekend but there are quite large differences between the pollsters figures ICM and ComRes have a larger gap between the two main parties than the other companies They put it at 14 and 12 respectively but that s still down from what they were showing two weeks ago The others have it at 6 10 There will no doubt be some talk about the fact that Labour has dropped two points in YouGov s poll compared to the one they published on Thursday But that still means that the gap is narrower than they found last weekend and it would be unwise to read too much into a small change between two individual polls The general trend is clear The Conservatives are still ahead but Labour has closed the gap Is the shift believable The godfather of psephology or the study of elections Sir David Butler said this week that the movement in the polls over this campaign is bigger than in any election he s covered since 1945 But many experts think that election campaigns don t make much difference voters views are set years or months before polling day So does that mean the polls must be wrong Not necessarily Voters have become much more volatile than they used to be much less loyal to a single party Chris Prosser and Jane Green from the British Election Study have shown that over the last 50 years the proportion of voters who switch parties between elections has risen from around 15 in the 1960s and 1970s to 43 in 2015 We can t be sure that the same will happen this time and many of the people who do switch might have made up their minds before the campaign started It s also possible that people who said they were going to switch at the start of the campaign have gone back to the party they supported before But if voters are more likely to change allegiance than in the past then perhaps we shouldn t be too surprised if the polls show large movements How reliable is Labour s vote One reason for caution about Labour s advance is that their improved polling numbers are based on very high levels of support among young voters and people who didn t vote in 2015 A big part of the problem with the polls in 2015 was that they failed to estimate accurately the difference in turnout rates among different groups of voters In particular they underestimated the turnout gap between young and old voters As I ve mentioned before many of the pollsters have adjusted their methods to try to overcome this problem But concerns remain about whether the people who say they ll vote Labour will actually do so on 8 June If they don t then Labour s vote share could be lower than the polls suggest Two new polls published on Thursday night suggest a further continuation of the trend we ve seen throughout the campaign so far The gap between the Conservatives and Labour has narrowed again It s down to eight points in Kantar Public s poll and just five points in YouGov s smaller than the actual gap between the parties at the 2015 election The Manchester attack has rightly meant that the country s attention has been focused away from the election But as the campaign resumes it s inevitable that people will ask whether it s had an effect on how people might vote So it s important to note that Kantar Public s poll was conducted before the attack but YouGov s was done afterwards on Wednesday and Thursday That doesn t mean we can say that the latest shift is related to the attack Theresa May has consistently had a strong lead over Jeremy Corbyn on the issues of defence and security That hasn t changed YouGov found that 55 of respondents trusted Theresa May to make the right decisions to keep Britain safe from terrorism compared to just 33 who trusted Jeremy Corbyn It s possible that the polls are still reacting to the fallout of the manifesto launches last week and the revisions to the Conservatives social care plans announced on Monday they denied it was a U turn There could also just be an element of natural polling variation Whatever the cause the important thing to remember is to look at the general trend rather than concentrating too much on individual polls The Conservatives retain a clear lead over Labour but the gap has closed significantly After the week of the manifesto launches for the main GB wide parties the trend of Labour improvement that we ve seen throughout the campaign is continuing In fact four polls released on Saturday for the Sunday papers suggest that the Labour advance has strengthened And while the Lib Dems and UKIP are still below where they were when the election was announced for the first time it looks as though the latest Labour rise is coming at the expense of the Conservatives The Conservative lead was generally around 20 points or a little above in the middle of April It s down to between 9 and 13 points in today s polls As ever the figures should be treated with caution It s particularly worth noting that none of the most recent polls come from the companies that tend to put Labour on a lower figure ICM and Kantar Public both make adjustments based on turnout rates for different groups of people at previous elections They ve had Labour at a lower level than some of the other companies throughout the campaign So it will be interesting to see whether their next polls follow a similar pattern Looking beneath the voting intention figures there are some clues about what might be causing the shift towards Labour that we ve seen One is voters responses to the manifestos For example Survation found that nearly half of respondents opposed Conservative plans for changes to the system of funding for social care By contrast Labour s plan to increase income tax for people earning over 80 000 was backed by more than six out of ten people and opposed by under a quarter Jeremy Corbyn has also seen an improvement in his approval ratings although he still lags a long way behind Theresa May For example Opinium have him on a net figure of 18 this week up from 28 last week Despite the significant moves we should still remember that the Conservatives retain a large lead by historical standards If today s polls were repeating on 8 June it would be the biggest gap between the two parties since Tony Blair s landslide in 1997 in terms of share of the vote There s also some evidence in the polls that the Labour vote is softer than the Conservative vote In other words more Labour voters than Conservative voters say they might change their minds Four polls over the weekend reinforced the picture of a Labour improvement during the course of the campaign so far ORB Opinium ComRes and YouGov all had them at 30 or above clearly above the levels seen at around the time the election was announced However this increase has not come at the expense of the Conservatives who remain in the mid to high 40s with a commanding lead The main losers have been UKIP who are down in the 3 6 range If the current polls were reflected in the final result it would mean the two main parties between them capturing a significantly larger share of the vote than at recent elections In 2015 they received a total of 69 The polls suggest a joint share of almost 80 You have to go back to 1992 to find an election where the total Conservative and Labour share was close to that the figure was 78 The last time it was above 80 was 1979 All the polls shown in the tracker report vote intention share across Great Britain but that s not very helpful for working out what s going on in parts of the UK where other parties stand However as we ve only seen two campaign polls in Scotland two in Wales and one in Northern Ireland so far there s not very much evidence to go on Having said that both of the Scottish polls conducted by Survation and YouGov have given the SNP over 40 with a clear lead over the Conservatives on 28 and Labour down in third place on 18 In Wales two YouGov polls have put the Conservatives ahead of Labour but with a smaller gap than across Britain as a whole Like in the national polls Labour s share has seen an improvement from the beginning of the campaign Plaid Cymru are back in third place In Northern Ireland the single Lucid Talk poll gave the DUP a narrow lead over Sinn Fein with the UUP SDLP and the Alliance all some way back As well as asking people which party they intend to vote for pollsters also ask which issues are the most important In 2015 the three biggest issues were the NHS immigration and the economy A significant change at this election is the emergence of Brexit Polls conducted since the election was called have put it at the top of the list of important issues ahead of the NHS in second place with the economy and immigration battling it out for third This may help to explain at least in part the Conservatives lead in the polls So far as we can tell they ve managed to attract the support of a large number of new voters who backed leave at last year s referendum whilst holding on to most of their own supporters who backed remain many of whom now think that the Government has a duty to implement the outcome of the referendum As everybody knows the polls got the 2015 general election wrong They suggested that the likely outcome was a hung parliament but as we know the Conservatives won an overall majority So is it worth paying attention to them this time Well we certainly shouldn t assume that the result will be exactly what the polls say But that doesn t mean they re completely useless For one thing critics have perhaps exaggerated other polling disasters The belief that the polls were just as bad at the EU referendum and in the US Presidential election is widely held However whilst some polls gave a misleading picture at the referendum others were pretty close We reported at the time that the polls overall indicated a very narrow race in the weeks running up to referendum day Similarly at the US election the national polls weren t that far off in terms of the share of the vote won by Donald Trump and Hilary Clinton Clinton actually won the popular vote by over 2 It was state polls that were unreliable and led to a misleading impression as to who would emerge from the Electoral College system as president In both cases if all we d taken from the polls was that the votes would be close we would have been on the right lines The polling companies have also made adjustments to try to prevent the problems of 2015 from happening again and to resolve issues that arose at the referendum These methodological changes vary from pollster to pollster but there are some general trends Several of them now ask the people who take part about their educational background The aim as with questions about class age gender and region is to get a sample of people who are representative of the population as a whole Others have developed more sophisticated ways to estimate how likely it is that somebody who takes part in a poll will actually vote Just asking people whether they will vote is not a good guide Of course we can t be sure whether these adjustments will make the polls more accurate So some people will no doubt decide to ignore them all together But there s still clearly an appetite for them No fewer than 30 have been conducted since the Prime Minister made her surprise announcement on 18 April That s more than one a day General election What you need to know It s now three weeks since the election was announced and the official campaign is well under way After Theresa May s surprise statement the Conservatives saw their poll rating jump with several polls suggesting a comfortable 20 point lead Since then nothing very dramatic has happened There has been a modest uptick for Labour who are generally up to the high 20s or around 30 up from the mid 20s just after the announcement But that still leaves a very large gap between the main two parties UKIP seem to have slipped a little further down and perhaps the Lib Dems have also fallen back a bit although these trends are not clear Most opinion polls and all of the ones covered in the BBC poll tracker are either conducted by telephone or online For phone polls the polling company rings up landline and mobile numbers In principle anyone with a phone could be asked to participate For internet polls the company maintains a panel of people who are prepared to take part For each poll they will contact the required number of panel members In both cases the company will aim to survey a sample of people who are representative of the country as a whole in terms of age gender social class etc They will generally then apply weighting adjustments if one or other group is over represented or under represented in their sample It s also common to seek a representative sample or apply a weighting based on past voting behaviour Polls included All polls conducted by companies which are members of the British Polling Council This includes BMG ComRes GfK

but how important are their clothes and what can we be looking out for during the general election campaign No politician wants to look as though they are overly interested in how they dress You ll see I wear only grey or blue suits President Barack Obama once said I m trying to pare down decisions I don t want to make decisions about what I m eating or wearing Because I have too many other decisions to make And few voters would want to admit that politicians clothes have much of an influence over how we vote The problem is experts tell us that with the clothes we wear we are constantly giving off and receiving signals whether we are conscious of it or not Speed modernity Theresa May a self proclaimed lover of fashion has had a long while to hone her choices while in the public eye and to understand what messages she is conveying Her clothes have been a subject of hot debate for at least 15 years when she caused a furore by wearing a pair of leopard print kitten heels to deliver a Conservative Party conference speech On the campaign trail notes Dr Vanessa Brown senior lecturer in design culture and context at Nottingham Trent University Mrs May tends towards to coin a phrase a strong and stable wardrobe It does not follow fashion too frivolously and suggests a woman who is in control and making rational choices yet with a flash of trying to connect through fashion She sometimes wears diagonal lines which can denote speed modernity looking forward and is a fan of quite structured tailoring allowing for some movement when interacting with the public and pounding the streets It s a style that s easier to wear than body skimming clothing without looking fussy or soft What about the famous shoes Will we be seeing some flamboyance there Possibly says Dr Brown though noting that Mrs May s famous flashes of fun in her wardrobe are only allowing that level of frivolity as far from her head as she could make it Jeremy Corbyn has also come under scrutiny for years over what he wears although for slightly different reasons Way back in 1984 he was being given a dressing down on BBC television for scruffy dress which he responded to while wearing a jumper knitted by his mother and criticising Tory MPs for voting in dinner jackets Despite having so far worn thoroughly respectable suits while campaigning the scruffy tag continues to haunt him One voter told a Daily Politics vox pop in Derby this month that Mr Corbyn looked like he d come out the back garden comparing him unfavourably with David Cameron who was smart I m not saying I wouldn t vote Labour but that has a big influence said the voter On the other hand Mr Corbyn s clothes seem to appeal to parts of the electorate Pop culture site Konbini recently ran a piece on how to look like him with tributes to his oversized blazers Breton caps and bicycle chic For politicians you can t appeal to every single voter so perhaps the important thing is to be authentic If you look like your natural self Dr Brown says people will find you more likeable and in turn more believable Mr Corbyn she said could perhaps sharpen it up a bit to make his look a little more intentional and Lib Dem leader Tim Farron who is similarly normally seen in a suit with or without a tie could also get away with a bit more Mr Farron looks exactly what he is she notes so presumably would score highly on any authenticity index but could perhaps play up any subversive side if he wanted to be more noticeable He is reported to wear Dr Martens every day with the Mirror at one point saying they almost suggest this man has flair personality hobbies Mr Farron could perhaps if that was the way he wanted to go play up his reported musical roots He told the Huffington Post in 2015 that in the late 1980s he had fronted a band written off as a fourth rate New Order and told Total Politics that he was once nearly a pop star explaining that his band got offered a recording session with Island Records but didn t do it On the campaign trail he has so far not caused a particular stir sartorially although he did get his pictures in a lot of media outlets when he boarded a hovercraft in Burnham on Sea clad in a lot of safety gear Politicians on the campaign trail do try to signal connectedness with voters by dressing according to their surroundings for instance by dressing down if they are visiting a refuge or charity centre Or think David Cameron wearing casualwear while playing with a lamb during a campaign visit in his Witney constituency in 2015 But go too far it seems and you will lose that sense of your authentic self politicians still wince at William Hague s baseball cap and that was from way back in 1997 The scrutiny But what about the formal events the podiums and set piece interviews What is often overlooked is how clothes make you feel Dr Brown says Suits with their structured tailoring provide an impermeable smooth outer casing a harder surface which can make you feel stronger and more in control That s why tailoring and monochrome colours are so popular they not only don t look like you re fussing they literally make you feel more invulnerable Although men are also increasingly under scrutiny for how they look it is still women s clothes that are really picked on and pored over An enormous amount has been written about SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon s clothes in the last couple of years the Daily Mail s recent Legs it front page comparing the legs of the prime minister and Scottish first minister while they were meeting to discuss Brexit and a second Scottish referendum being a case in point Ms Sturgeon who like Theresa May has appeared in Vogue and does say she is interested in fashion has said she is conflicted by the scrutiny she comes under and that there is too much focus on what women wear I do have a concern that for women if women politicians prime ministers first ministers are always reduced to how they look and what they wear and their legs then we re saying something that we probably shouldn t be saying about the status of women she recently told BBC Breakfast So I think that focus on appearance is probably something we should try to move away from Perhaps that scrutiny partly influences her and other women politicians fondness for single colour suits and tailored dresses Minimalism says Dr Brown tends to appeal to politicians All the scrutiny can lead to quite similar wardrobes of plain styles because the more you experiment the more potential mistakes more for people to talk about So a shift dress is where you end up He s wearing clothes It s almost enough to make you feel sorry for politicians having to convey through their outfits all these messages about control intelligence entitlement to power authenticity while still trying to make people want to vote for them And you can t really say it doesn t matter because as Dr Brown says often for politicians a few words and their appearance are more significant than the depth of what they might say Most of us don t engage very deeply in the detail of political offerings so what else are people going on But of course not everybody goes in for the idea that clothes are a set of signifiers sending off complex unconscious messages UKIP leader Paul Nuttall for instance has been notable for wearing a lot of tweed a hint perhaps of Britishness and a traditional lifestyle although so far on this campaign trail he has mainly been photographed in a dark blue suit and tie Is there a particular message he is trying to convey through his clothes BBC News asked No said UKIP head of press Gawain Towler He s wearing clothes because some suit the outside and some suit the inside just like you and I would wear clothes", "Share this with Email Facebook Messenger

Liberal Democrats have warned The party s Brexit spokesman Nick Clegg said losing access to the Schengen Information System would be Euroscepticism gone mad The Schengen Information System allows police across Europe to access information on criminals and suspects The Conservatives said the Lib Dems were peddling nonsense Under the Schengen Information System which the UK joined in 2015 police and border forces in EU member states and four associated countries enter and receive alerts about wanted and missing people as well as potential witnesses and items that could be used as evidence Both the UK and EU backed close cooperation on security matters when they outlined their Brexit negotiating strategies In the document setting out its negotiation aims the government lists the Schengen Information System as an example of the mutually beneficial model of cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorism It said the UK would continue to cooperate closely with our European partners on security matters and negotiate the best deal we can with the EU to cooperate in the fight against crime and terrorism But Mr Clegg said countries must abide by EU data protection and privacy laws in return for access to the system and to accept rulings of the European Court of Justice which Prime Minister Theresa May has indicated the UK will not do The former deputy prime minister told the Today programme that the database was by far the largest and most sophisticated of its kind and was accessed 16 times a second on average by UK officials There s a huge difference between saying we want a deal and making a deal feasible and possible he said This is where I think the Conservatives need to stop dare I say it patronising people by constantly saying we ll sort it out don t worry your pretty little heads Unless they have concrete answers on how your square the circle of wanting to have access to data which can only be legally both uploaded and accessed if all the participating countries abide by rulings from the European Court of Justice however much people keep saying they want this to happen it won t happen in reality He added We were told by Theresa May

But the substance of his message was miles away from Tony Blair s approach to foreign policy There is a pretty obvious reason why Jeremy Corbyn drew a link between intervention in foreign wars and acts of terrorism here He believes it He has said similar things during his two Labour leadership contests except this time he points out that this view is shared more widely by experts But there are political considerations too Those who flooded in to Labour in 2015 from the Greens the Stop the War coalition or who simply got involved in politics for the first time to support his leadership will be delighted to hear him set out a direction that is distinctive not just from the Conservatives but from recent Labour leaders They may be encouraged to step up their campaigning as a result But the party is divided between recent and long standing members Had the franchise for the last Labour leadership contest been limited to the membership of 2015 Owen Smith would have replaced Jeremy Corbyn Publicly and more often privately many of Jeremy Corbyn s MPs are dismayed he willingly strayed in to foreign policy today Some of them are fighting relentlessly local campaigns not mentioning their leader on their literature and opposing spending cuts in their area So they wanted him to focus on cuts on police numbers They worry that despite his protestations arguing about the underlying causes of terrorism at this stage in a political campaign will allow opponents to claim he is somehow looking for excuses for it Some of them have told me privately that their campaigns have been going better as a result of their leader s recent lower profile But Jeremy Corbyn will have noted that around a million young people have applied for a vote since the election was called and he thinks this is an untapped reservoir of support which is more likely to flow to Labour if the party appears to be radical More widely though voters of whatever political persuasion will have a clearer idea tonight on when and whether Jeremy Corbyn would sanction military action This founder of the Stop the War coalition set out clear conditions from proper resourcing to the contribution to lasting peace

needed to be reviewed as she was asked about what her party would do to increase security Prevent was set up by Labour in 2003 and its remit was widened by the Conservative Lib Dem coalition in 2011 Home Secretary Amber Rudd recently said if the Conservatives were re elected the strategy would receive more money Setting out her views on Prevent on the Andrew Marr Show Ms Lucas said Many in the Muslim community believe it s been an attack on their group in particular We absolutely want there to be a mechanism whereby people can come to the state with concerns but when it is perceived by the Muslim community itself as being a toxic Big Brother brand then we need to look at it again Prevent is designed to support people at risk of joining extremist groups and carrying out terrorist activities focusing on schools faith organisations prisons and other communities where people can be at risk of radicalisation Ms Lucas also defended her opposition to mass online surveillance saying

home secretary said she did not know how many potential jihadists had returned to the UK from war zones Asked if it was possible to tell where someone travelling into the UK had left from she said It

claims it had a mandate Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale dismissed claims she had not been clear on the issue And Ruth Davidson ruled out any second ballot until after 2021 The SNP has said it has a mandate to hold a second referendum despite the 2014 vote being a once in a generation event It said it included the right to hold another independence ballot in the event of a material change to Scotland s circumstances It insisted that the Brexit vote in which 62 in Scotland voted to remain in the EU a majority albeit reduced at Holyrood last year and a vote in March by the Scottish Parliament to stage another referendum constituted a mandate Speaking on the BBC s Sunday Politics Scotland Ms Dugdale who has previously said Labour MPs and MSPs could campaign for independence if a second referendum was staged insisted she would block any second ballot She said Everywhere I go I meet people who are distressed upset and worried about the instability a second referendum would cause and indeed the damage independence would cause We have been very clear we are opposed to independence and a second independence referendum The reality is now our job is to block a referendum here in Scotland Because the people of Scotland don t want it nor do they want independence And Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson who has seen her party stage an electoral revival on the back of her vocal opposition to another independence vote said she did not believe the SNP had a mandate for a second referendum She insisted on the programme that there was no public consent to hold another vote and if there had to be one it could only be after 2021 at the earliest She said the SNP are going to argue for another referendum till the cows come home I don t accept they have a mandate There has got to be both political and public consent for this And she said there could not be any second vote held until after a Brexit deal had been negotiated and its effects played out on the ground

leader Willie Rennie joined in the chorus against staging a second referendum while campaigning in East Dunbartonshire He said The Scottish economy is teetering on the edge of a recession the performance of Scottish education is dropping down the international rankings and mental health services are failing to deliver the care we expect People should use their vote to change the direction of the country away from another divisive independence referendum But SNP deputy leader Angus Robertson said there was only one way for Scotland s voice to be heard adding Scotland needs MPs who will

splendid afro at the time I don t have the same hairstyle I don t have the same views she said Home Secretary Amber Rudd later said she had changed her own hair many times but not her views on

calling for the abolition of MI5 saying it was in need of reform but she said she would not do so today because of changes since then The Labour front bencher said she had voted against one motion

radicalisation has once again come under scrutiny Reality Check has been looking at the government s Prevent programme asking how it works and why it divides opinion Prevent is one of four strands of the government s counter terrorism strategy known as Contest It was created by the Labour government in 2003 and its remit was widened by the coalition government in 2011 The other strands are Prepare Protect and Pursue Prevent is designed to support people at risk of joining extremist groups and carrying out terrorist activities In practice it means police and other organisations trying to build relations across the UK and putting programmes in places such as schools faith organisations prisons and other communities where people can be at risk of radicalisation It requires faith leaders teachers doctors and others to refer any suspicions to a local Prevent body An assessment is then made about whether further action is needed Social services departments have become increasingly involved in identifying Prevent cases because of their duty to counter radicalisation About 7 500 referrals were made to the scheme in 2015 16 the equivalent of 20 a day according to a Freedom of Information Request to the National Police Chiefs Council NPCC Out of those referrals action was taken in one in every 10 cases No action at all was taken in 37 of the cases while a quarter of people referred were found to be vulnerable but not at risk of terrorist involvement The remaining 28 were still being considered In cases where an ideology was recorded just over half related to Islamist extremism and nearly one in 10 were linked to far right extremism In some areas of the country including parts of north west England the number of far right referrals far outstrips the number of Islamist cases Where action is taken an individual can be placed on the government s Channel Programme This is a support plan which may include mentoring The annual Prevent budget is not officially published but it is thought to be around 40m a year We do know that after the revised strategy was published in 2011 the government set aside 46m of spending 36m from the Home Office and 10m from the Foreign Office David Anderson the former independent reviewer of terror legislation has said Prevent receives 1 of the overall 3bn counter terrorism budget While the Prevent strategy has divided opinion the government says it is working It says 150 people including 50 children were stopped from entering conflict zones in Iraq and Syria in 2015 because of the strategy The government also says that its counter radicalisation programmes reached more than 42 000 people in 2015 16 The strategy is also backed by senior police figures The Leicestershire Chief Constable Simon Cole has called it absolutely fundamental in tackling terrorism in the UK He said the scheme was about putting an arm around people at risk of radicalisation We try and divert allow people the opportunity to help them make better decisions It s absolutely fundamental It has enabled us to try and help stabilise communities and stop people getting us into a cycle of aggravation The Prevent strategy has been criticised by some MPs the National Union of Teachers and the Muslim Council of Britain Some argue the strategy is counterproductive and that it can make Islamic students for example feel isolated and possibly more open to radicalisation Another worry is that it can add to a general sense of distrust across communities A former senior Muslim police officer Dal Babu said in 2015 that Prevent had become tainted and toxic He argued that Muslim community organisations have this Prevent label stamped on them and are then vilified The Muslim Council of Britain says Prevent is too intrusive and references are over zealous It gives an example of two college students stopped by a lecturer who noticed that they had made way for two female students and lowered their gaze The Council says they were reported to the senior team for concerning behaviour Another problem is that it is very difficult to measure the full extent of the strategy s successes and failures It is impossible to know how many people may or may not have gone on to commit terrorist acts without coming into contact with Prevent The Conservative manifesto does not make specific mention to Prevent It does however say We will continue to invest in our world leading security services and maintain and develop our counter terrorism strategy to protect us from terrorism at home and abroad Speaking to BBC Radio 4 s Today programme in the aftermath of the Manchester attack Home Secretary Amber Rudd said that if the Conservatives were re elected the strategy would receive more money Labour s manifesto pledges to review the Prevent programme with a view to assessing both its effectiveness and its potential to alienate minority communities It says In doing so we will address the government s failure to take any effective new measures against a growing problem of extreme or violent radicalisation The Liberal Democrats say they will scrap Prevent altogether Its manifesto says it will replace it with a scheme that prioritises community engagement and supports communities in developing their own approach to tackling the dangers of violent extremism The SNP is yet to publish its manifesto However the party has previously called for a review into Prevent saying the strategy leads to confusion and alienation and risks being significantly counter productive UKIP s manifesto does not explicitly mention Prevent The party did pledge however to segregate extremists from the wider prison population to prevent a spread of radicalisation Read more on Reality Check Follow us on Twitter Read more from

the campaign trail ahead of elections in September The times in which we could completely depend on others are on the way out I ve experienced that in the last few days Mrs Merkel told a crowd at an election rally in Munich southern Germany The relationship between Berlin and new French President Emmanuel Macron had to be a priority Mrs Merkel said adding We Europeans have to take our destiny

re affirmed their support for the Paris accord but Mr Trump said he would make a decision in the coming week Mr Trump has previously pledged to abandon the Paris deal and expressed doubts about climate change Speaking in Brussels last week Mr Trump also told Nato members to spend more money on defence and did not re state his administration s commitment to Nato s mutual security guarantees

rival Martin Schulz has fizzled out And Sunday s beer tent event underscored her strength by marking an end to a potential split with her Bavarian sister conservative party She might not have welcomed Brexit or Trump But it seems that Mrs Merkel has decided that standing up for the EU will only strengthen her chances of winning another term in September"]
