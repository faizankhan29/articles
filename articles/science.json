information from audio recordings of gunshots could give forensic case officers new avenues for solving murder cases The hustle and bustle of a city going about its business is broken by the crack of gunshots sending bystanders running and screaming In the aftermath one man lies dead and another badly injured Further down the street four security cameras outside a local resident s home picked up the sound of the exchange of fire between the two men but no images of what happened Eyewitnesses reported seeing the pair standing just a few metres apart firing handguns at each other but it is unclear which of the two perpetrators shot first In an attempt to unravel what happened local police called Robert Maher a professor in electrical and computer engineering at Montana State University Using audio captured by the microphones on the security cameras he was able to reconstruct the incident shot by shot to reveal where each of the men were standing and who fired first Prof Maher is one of a small group of acoustics experts working to establish a new field of forensics that examines the sound of gunshots recorded on camera footage or by phones Nowadays it is not uncommon for someone with a cell phone to be making a video at the time of a gunfire incident he explains The most common types of recordings are from dashboard cameras or vest mounted cameras carried by law enforcement officers Also common are recordings from an emergency telephone call centres where the calls are being recorded and the caller s phone picks up a gunshot sound In some cases there are private surveillance systems at homes and businesses that include audio recordings Gunshots make a distinctive sound that makes them easy to distinguish from other commonly mistaken noises such as a car backfiring or fireworks A firearm produces an abrupt blast of intense noise from the muzzle that lasts just one or two millionths of a second before disappearing again High powered rifles also produce an additional sonic boom as the bullet passes through the sound barrier before the sound of the muzzle blast is detected Most of us spend our lives surrounded by devices capable of capturing these sounds inadvertently if a crime occurs nearby Professor Maher s aim is to extract details from these recordings that might help police piece together a crime Together with his colleagues he has been compiling a database of firearm sounds in a project funded by US National Institute of Justice They are firing an array of rifles shotguns semiautomatic pistols and revolvers beside an array of 12 microphones arranged in a semicircle Each of the guns appear broadly similar to human ears when fired on an open range but using software to analyse the sound waves picked up by the microphones they have found it is possible to distinguish different types of weapon We observe differences between pistols with differing calibre and barrel length for example says Professor Maher Revolvers differ from pistols because sound can emanate from the gap between the revolver cylinder and the gun barrel causing two sound sources that can be detected at certain angles His analysis has also revealed other details can be gleaned from recordings of gunfire The shape of the sound wave produced by a gunshot for example is different depending on which way the weapon is pointing If the microphone is off to one side of the shooter the split second burst of noise can different compared to when it is in front of or behind the gun They have also found it is possible to pick up distinct echoes as the initial sound produced by a gunshot reverberates off nearby buildings parked cars trees and walls After the initial blast other smaller blips in the sound wave can be seen within a fraction of a second of the shot By calculating the time it takes for sound to travel to and from an obstacle it is possible to calculate how far a shooter was away from it It can even reveal if a shooter was firing from an elevated position from the muzzle blast reflecting off the ground This means the orientation and location of shooters in some circumstances can be determined according to Prof Maher who revealed some of his findings to a symposium organised by the National Institute of Justice in New Orleans last month In situations where more than one recording of the shooting scene is available such as where two or more patrol cars equipped with dashboard audio or video recorders are present at an incident the position of the vehicles can sometimes help triangulate the sounds It is a similar concept to the one used by companies like Raytheon which produces sniper locators for the military that use the sound of a gunshot to locate the shooter An array of microphones can be mounted on buildings vehicles or helicopters to help spot shots Another firm Shotspotter uses a network of microphones across 90 cities in the US to help law enforcement detect gunshots The difference with these systems is that they detect gunfire in real time while Professor Maher is trying piece together what happened days weeks and even months after a shooting In the case described at the start of this article a real shooting that occurred recently in Cincinnati Ohio the injured man claimed he had shot the other man dead in self defence after he was fired at first With the two gunshots occurring less than a second apart it was impossible for witnesses to definitely say which of the shooters had fired first Using the security camera recordings of a local home owner living further down the street however Professor Maher was able to reveal two distinct gunshots in the audio Just a few milliseconds after the first gunshot a distinct second blip appeared in the sound wave just moments before the second shot was fired This blip was the echo of the first gunshot bouncing off a large building at a T junction around 90 metres to the north The echo from the second gunshot was far harder to spot in the sound waves produced According to Professor Maher this suggests the first shooter to fire their gun was the one pointing it to the north the same man who claimed he had been firing in self defence Professor Maher hopes the growing amount of technology capable of recording audio will make such analysis even easier in the future The microphones on many older consumer devices are not designed to handle the abrupt loud sounds of gunshots and it can overload them But as more homes become equipped with home security cameras and always on smart assistants like Amazon s Echo and Google Home it may be possible to capture better audio of events It is something that other forensics experts believe could have a growing role in the future Mike Brookes a reader in communications and signal processing at Imperial College London said The sort of question that such recordings can help with are in sorting out the timing and sequence of events that took place and in establishing the position from which a gun was fired", "Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window Flamingos expend less energy standing on one leg than in a two legged stance scientists have confirmed It may be their signature pose but how and why the birds perch on one limb has been a longstanding puzzle Now a team from the US has shown that flamingos employ no active muscular effort when they re unipedal meaning they are also expending less energy A passive mechanism is engaged in the one legged position allowing flamingos to stand proud while having a doze Previously researchers had wondered whether the one legged position might help reduce muscle fatigue as the birds alternated from standing on one leg to the other Other teams have proposed that this behaviour helps regulate body temperature Now Prof Young Hui Chang from the Georgia Institute of Technology Georgia Tech in Atlanta and Lena H Ting of Atlanta s Emory University have uncovered the mechanical secrets behind this impressive trick The researchers conducted several experiments with both live and dead birds Amazingly they found that flamingo cadavers could be made to stand one legged without any external support In a paper published in the Royal Society journal Biology Letters they describe this phenomenon as a passive gravitational stay mechanism If you look at the bird from the front while they re standing on one leg the foot is directly beneath the body which means that their leg is angled inward That s the pose you have to strike in order to engage the stay mechanism Prof Chang told BBC News However dead birds cannot stand unsupported on two legs suggesting a greater role for active muscle force in this posture If you tilt it to the vertical like you would if you were standing on two legs the whole thing disengages said the director of the Comparative Neuromechanics Laboratory at Georgia Tech The researchers also studied live birds and showed that when they were standing one legged and resting they hardly moved at all underlining the stability of this passive position However the birds did sway somewhat when the one legged posture was combined with an activity such as grooming or calling out Prof Chang said the underlying anatomical apparatus that enables the passive posture was not yet understood this is the next step in the team s research But he explained that the phenomenon did not involve the limb joints locking A lock would imply that it s fixed in both directions What we found is that it s fixed in one direction but flexible in the other direction so we call it a stay rather than a lock It s more akin to a doorstop he told me Dr Matthew Anderson an experimental psychologist who specialises in animal behaviour at St Joseph s University in Philadelphia described the team s results as a significant step forward The researcher who was not involved with the latest study added They begin to answer the question of how flamingos are able to rest on one leg Importantly these authors do not examine when and where flamingos actually utilise the behaviour in question and thus this paper does not really address the issue of why flamingos rest while on one leg Dr Anderson s own research suggests that the birds adopt the unusual posture in order to conserve heat Among other things his team found that the number of birds resting on one leg falls as temperatures rise Providing evidence of the mechanism that supports allows for the behaviour to occur does not necessarily provide insight into why it happens in the first place Follow Paul on Twitter", "Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy

over sharing patient data In a letter dated February and leaked to Sky News Dame Fiona Caldicott throws doubt on the legality of sharing 1 6 million patient records Patients should have been informed about the deal she says Google said that the deal was covered by implied consent This rule exists to allow the NHS to share medical data with third parties for direct patient care without informing patients about each deal In the case of the partnership with DeepMind data was collected from patients at the Royal Free Hospital Trust in London in order to test an app to help doctors and nurses identify those who might be at risk of acute kidney disease In her letter to Prof Stephen Powis medical director of the Royal Free Hospital in London Dame Fiona said We keenly appreciate the great benefits that new technologies such as Streams can offer to patients in terms of better safer more timely care But she added It is absolutely paramount that this is done in a transparent and secure manner which helps to build public trust otherwise the full benefits of such developments will not be realised and indeed harm may be done She questioned the use of implied consent as the legal basis for the transfer of identifiable patient records because the data was initially used just to test the app My considered opinion therefore remains that it would not have been within the reasonable expectation of patients that their records would have been shared for this purpose she says She has written to the Information Commissioner s Office ICO which is currently investigating the data sharing deal and is due to report its findings imminently In response to the leaked letter a Royal Free London representative said The Streams app was built in close collaboration with clinicians to help prevent unnecessary deaths by alerting them to patients in need in a matter of seconds It is now in use at the Royal Free and is helping clinicians provide better faster care to our patients Nurses report that it is saving them hours each day DeepMind said We re glad the NDG has said that further guidance would be useful to organisations which are undertaking work to test new technologies

of debris on its beaches The island is near the centre of an ocean current meaning it collects much rubbish from boats and South America Researchers hope people will rethink their relationship with plastic The joint Australian and British study said the rubbish amounted to 671 items per square metre and a total of 17 tonnes A lot of the items on Henderson Island are what we wrongly refer to as disposable or single use said Dr Jennifer Lavers from the University of Tasmania The study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences described how remote islands act as a sink for the world s rubbish In addition to fishing items Henderson Island was strewn with everyday things including toothbrushes cigarette lighters and razors Land crabs are making their homes inside bottle caps containers and jars Dr Lavers told the BBC At first it looks a little bit cute but it s not This plastic is old it s sharp it s brittle and toxic A large number of hard hats of every shape colour and size were also discovered the marine scientist said Henderson Island is listed by Unesco as a coral atoll with a relatively unique ecology notable for 10 plant and four bird species It is 190km 120 miles from Pitcairn Island about 5 000km from Chile and sits near the centre of the South Pacific Gyre a massive rotating current The condition of the island highlighted how plastic debris has affected the environment on a global scale Dr Lavers said Almost every island in the world and almost every species in the ocean is now being shown to be impacted one way or another by our waste she said There s not really any one person or any one country that gets a free pass on this She said plastic was devastating to oceans because it was buoyant and durable The research was

American space agency s new Juno mission say its initial observations at Jupiter have taken their breath away In particular they have been amazed by the storms seen at the planet s poles Think of a bunch of hurricanes every one the size of the Earth all packed so close together that each hurricane touches the other said Mike Janssen Even in rooms of hardened researchers these images of swirling clouds have drawn gasps the Nasa man added The Juno probe arrived at the fifth planet from the Sun on 4 July last year Since then it has been making a close pass over the gas giant every 53 days The first data to come out of these observations are now being reported in two papers here and here in the journal Science and in more than 40 others in a special collection for Geophysical Research Letters The mission team says that in nearly all instances previously cherished theories about how Jupiter works are being challenged We re getting the first really close up and personal look at Jupiter and we re seeing that a lot of our ideas were incorrect and maybe naive said Juno principal investigator Scott Bolton from the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio Texas Those big cyclones that cover the highest latitudes of the planet are only now being seen in detail because previous missions to the planet never really got to look from above and below like Juno certainly not at such a high resolution Features down to 50km across can be discerned The structures are very different from those seen at Saturn s poles for example and the team will have to explain why It is also not clear at this stage how long lived they are Will they dissipate much faster than the storms at lower latitudes which in some cases as with the famous Great Red Spot on Jupiter have persisted for centuries Another surprise comes from Juno s Microwave Radiometer MWR which senses behaviour below the visible cloud surface Its data indicates the presence of a broad band of ammonia around the equator that goes from the top of the atmosphere to as deep as it is possible to detect at least 350km down It could be part of a major circulation system But the MWR records the ammonia at higher latitudes to be much more variable What this is telling us is that Jupiter is not very well mixed on the inside said Dr Bolton The idea that once you drop below the sunlight everything would be uniform and boring was completely wrong It s actually very different dependent on where you look Mission team members picked out a number of highlights in the new results One concerned the magnetic field of Jupiter It was known to be strong but it has now been determined to be even stronger than expected a doubling of the assumed strength where the probe makes its closest approach to the planet the field is about 10 times the strength of Earth s magnetic field But the signal is quite lumpy which tells the scientists that the dynamo system the electrically conducting region generating the field is probably not that deep into the planet When we see small spatial scale variation it indicates to us that we may be very close to the source and so that might mean the dynamo is above the metallic hydrogen layers and it may operate in the molecular hydrogen envelope above That s very significant said Jack Connerney Juno s deputy principal investigator and the lead for the mission s magnetic field investigation It is the magnetic field investigation that is also at the heart of trying to understand Jupiter s very bright auroras its northern and south lights And again what Juno is finding is not what everyone was expecting The auroras should result from electrons running down field lines and then striking the atmosphere But the current carried by the electrons should have its own magnetic signature and Juno has not at this stage been able to detect it It s got us all scratching our heads I have to say said UK scientist Dr Jonathan Nichols from the University of Leicester We see the auroras we have a good idea we think of how they re generated but when it comes down it we re not seeing the signature of supposedly millions of amps of current One very smart picture taken by Juno and released on Thursday showed the ring of dust that surrounds Jupiter It is not well known that Jupiter has a ring but it does What was clever was getting the familiar stars of the Orion constellation to be in on the shot as well This is the first image of Jupiter s ring that has ever been collected from the inside of it looking out said mission scientist Heidi Becker from Nasa Juno is 3 000 miles from the planet when we took this picture So what you re looking at is a ring of dust that s 40 000 miles away and stars that are hundreds of light years away all in the same picture It is early days in the mission still it is likely to run for several years yet but the first gravity sensing data is pointing to some weirdness in respect of Jupiter s centre Theories had suggested it either had a relatively small rocky core or no core at all one suggestion was that the planet s gases went all the way down to the centre in an ever more compressed state Scientists are now considering something in between a diffuse core It really looks fuzzy said Dr Bolton There may be a core there but it s very big and it may be partially dissolved and we re studying that Dr Bolton

Unseasonably high temperatures last year caused the permafrost to melt sending water into the access tunnel No seeds were damaged but the facility is to have new waterproof walls in the tunnel and drainage ditches outside The vault stores seeds from 5 000 crop species from around the world Dried and frozen it is believed they can be preserved for hundreds of years Although most countries keep their own supplies of key varieties the Global Seed Vault acts as a back up If a nation s seeds are lost as a result of a natural disaster or a man made catastrophe the specimens stored in the Arctic could be used to regenerate them Scientists at the facility describe the vault as the most important room in the world Government spokeswoman Hege Njaa Aschim told the BBC that the reason the vault was built on Svalbard was because the permafrost was thought to be permanent She said the problems emerged last October when the temperatures instead of being 10C or colder were hovering around 0C It was like a wet summer in Norway she told the BBC Inside the mountain it s safe but the problems we have experienced are just outside and in the front of the tunnel which is the entrance So Yes maybe something has changed in the permafrost but we don t know and that is what the climate researchers are looking into We have to follow them carefully The new measures announced include drainage ditches

is the finding of a new study that investigated high altitude adaptation in mountain populations The research involved taking muscle samples from mountaineers at 5 300m altitude and even putting them on an exercise bike at Mt Everest Base Camp The Sherpas owe this ability to an advantageous genetic mutation that gives them a unique metabolism It has long been a puzzle that Sherpas can cope with the low oxygen atmosphere present high in the Himalayas far better than those visiting the region Mountaineers trekking to the area can adapt to the low oxygen by increasing the number of red cells in their blood increasing its oxygen carrying capacity In contrast Sherpas actually have thinner blood with less haemoglobin and a reduced capacity for oxygen although this does have the advantage that the blood flows more easily and puts less strain on the heart This shows that it s not how much oxygen you ve got it s what you do with it that counts concludes Cambridge University s Prof Andrew Murray the senior author on the new study Sherpas are extraordinary performers especially on the high Himalayan peaks So there s something really unusual about their physiology he told the BBC World Service s Science In Action programme Unravelling what is different involved a substantial scientific expedition to Everest Base Camp where the high altitude response of 10 mostly European researchers and 15 elite Sherpas could be compared For participants like James Horscroft whose PhD was based on the data he got from this Xtreme Everest 2 venture this meant not just a chance to explore one of the planet s most remote regions but also a lot of pressure It was very stressful because we only had this one chance to get our data high in the Himalaya For James like all the others those data included samples of muscle punctured from the thigh While some samples were frozen to be taken back to university labs others were experimented on in a makeshift lab at the base camp We had to start at seven in the morning because it took four hours to do all the tests on one sample James said At that time the temperature could be 10 degrees below freezing so we d be all wrapped up and wearing gloves By late morning it would rise to plus 25 and we d be taking all our kit off What the biochemical tests on the fresh muscle showed was that the Sherpas tissue was able to make much better use of oxygen by limiting the amount of body fat burned and maximising the glucose consumption Fat is a great fuel but the problem is that it s more oxygen hungry than glucose Prof Murray explained In other words by preferentially burning body sugar rather than body fat the Sherpas can get more calories per unit of oxygen breathed The result impresses Federico Formenti of King s College London whose own trekking study a decade ago monitoring oxygen consumption through breath sensors suggested Sherpas can produce 30 more power than lowlanders This paper provides a cellular mechanism for what we found at the whole body level that Sherpas use less oxygen to do the same job he says James Horscroft agrees the difference in performance is impressive It was pretty clear straight away that our tissue experiments were showing different metabolisms for the two groups In fact the difference was so astounding we were worried if the tests were working But back in Cambridge the results were borne out And a genetic variation altering the way fats are burned was established too While all of the Sherpas carried the glucose favouring variant of the metabolic gene almost none of the lowland volunteers did Sherpas are a specific population amongst the Nepalese the Ferraris of the Himalayans Formenti calls them who migrated to the country 500 years ago from Tibet which has been occupied by humans for at least 6 000 years That is plenty of time for a beneficial gene to become embedded Prof Murray argues It s not down to one gene of course We see better blood flow through the capillaries and they appear to have a richer capillary network as well so that the oxygen can be delivered better to the tissues But this gene would also have given them some advantage Other recent studies have shown that some genes that help Tibetans survive at high altitude come from the recently discovered extinct human species known as the Denisovans although there is no evidence yet that the metabolic gene is among them The Sherpa study is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences You can hear an interview with Prof Murray on this week s Science In Action programme to be broadcast

threatens traditional food supplies in the Arctic one rural Alaskan village is flying in hundreds of reindeer by cargo plane James Cook went to find out why Only 12 000 years late on an experimental farm outside Fairbanks in central Alaska Greg Finstad is proposing an agricultural revolution For the indigenous communities of the north he is advocating a move from hunting to farming in particular to farming reindeer Finstad who runs the reindeer research programme at the University of Alaska Fairbanks says the subsistence lifestyle of rural communities on the Yukon river is under serious threat in a time of tumultuous change Softly spoken his eyes shaded from the sunshine by a baseball cap Finstad is a disarming mix of wit charm and frankness They re off the road system he says They have to ship very expensive food They re very worried about starving and it s a legitimate concern For those who have traditionally relied on subsistence hunting these are indeed challenging times Polar bears are scarcer than ever and even for the few with permits to hunt the animals tracking them on thinning ice is becoming ever more dangerous Wild caribou herds have been shrinking for reasons that are not entirely clear And last year saw the lowest harvest of pink salmon since 1977 although sockeye salmon have been more resilient A more unpredictable climate may be affecting the animals migration patterns and food sources although some recent evidence suggests they may now be adapting to those changes What is not in doubt according to more than 90 scientists who contributed to a recent report by an Arctic Council working group is rising concentrations of greenhouse gases are driving widespread changes in the Arctic s sensitive climate According to the report ice on sea and land is declining permafrost is warming and spring snow cover is retreating With each additional year of data it becomes increasingly clear that the Arctic as we know it is being replaced by a warmer wetter and more variable environment say the authors who add that the transformation has profound implications for people resources and ecosystems worldwide One Yukon river community Steven s Village has purchased a 2 000 acre 800 hectare farm The plan is to raise some 1 500 to 2 000 reindeer to feed the village to sell and to act as a staging area for livestock for other settlements Finstad thinks deer are hardier than cattle and in any case he is not a fan of the beef industry which he accuses of trying to stymie reindeer production If you compare beef to reindeer we flat out kick their butt every time in flavour he insists He says the plan is to load hundreds of reindeer on to a Douglas DC 6 transport plane and fly them from the west coast of Alaska to the interior to start the new farm This seed stock for Steven s Village may come from Nome on the Seward peninsula which juts out towards Russia between the Bering and Chukchi seas There is a historical twist here The Seward peninsula is the region where reindeer were first introduced to the United States from Siberia in 1892 because Alaskan whaling communities were struggling to survive Maintaining the reindeer population on the peninsula has been difficult Stopping animals running off with migrating caribou herds is a particular challenge Caribou and reindeer are the same species Rangifer tarandus but in North America the semi domesticated variety are known as reindeer and the wild herds are known as caribou in Europe the word caribou is not used at all Ann and Bruce Davis who have a thriving reindeer herd in Nome at their Midnite Sun Reindeer Ranch also rhapsodise about the properties of the meat The fat is deposited on the outside of the reindeer and not marbled within the meat so the meat is very lean says Bruce Davis The fat doesn t go to waste though The Inupiat people mix it with a variety of berries to make a concoction which the Davises say is known locally as Eskimo ice cream It s very high in carbs and fat and so it s a good source of energy and it s pretty good to eat too says Ann Davis before offering a word of caution It s nothing like American ice cream There are plenty of other ways to eat reindeer including roasting it with garlic and herbs frying the animal s heart or in a traditional Sami bidu or feast stew Before reindeer consumption becomes widespread though there is a problem to overcome Reindeer have rather good PR Greg Finstad admits It s the perception that reindeer are on this planet to pull a sled with this chubby guy in a red suit and a white beard but that s actually not true he says Reindeer are on this planet to feed people So I guess it s my job to take the magic of Christmas We have to eat Rudolph I ask Yes answers Finstad his expression

protect these birds from collisions Other ideas being tried include placing highly visible deflectors every 20m on power lines The Rift Valley and Red Sea flyways in Egypt are among the world s busiest corridors with huge numbers of migrating birds travelling between Europe and Africa twice a year Around 1 2 million birds of prey 500 000 white storks and 66 000 white pelican migrate each year along this particular flyway Some will cover 10 000km on their journey Unfortunately this area is also where Egypt is developing new large scale wind farms At one wind park El Zayt over 290 000 migratory birds flew through it in 2014 Concerned about the impact the twirling blades may have on the species flying over the Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency in collaboration with the wind farm developers and bird experts set out to test a new shut down on demand protection system In Spring 2016 they set up two radar units with field ornithologists on site located at vantage points 2 5 5km from the wind farm and less than 5km apart When birds were detected the turbines could be shut down within four minutes Details of the trial are still being assessed but according to those who presented details of it at this meeting it was a success We are still awaiting the monitoring information said Aida Kowalska from Birdlife International The project went really well and it s a great success we ve managed to pilot guidelines that actually work on a wind farm site The researchers say that they are fine tuning the system increasing the number of birds that trigger the shutdown from 10 to 50 It could be used with other wind farms they say but it is not a one size fits all solution to the issues of birds and renewable energy It s a model that could be applied elsewhere but it is particularly useful in the context of migration said Edward Perry also from Birdlife International This is one of many measures you can take but the first step should be identifying the best site to reduce the impact in the first place The delegates also heard about efforts in Germany to reduce collisions between birds and electricity cables The country s rapid uptake of renewables particularly wind have seen a speedy growth in the number of pylons and wires being used to carry power from the north where it is generated to the south and west where it is mainly consumed According to Eric Neuling from conservation campaigners Nabu more than 1 5 million birds smash into electric wires every year Grid operators were very initially very sceptical about bird protection but since the 1990s there have been many mutually benefitting projects according to Eric The protectors are put up on the ground wire which is the very thin wire on the top of the power lines themselves he told BBC News The one that works best is a black and white contrasting moving deflector around 50cm high that gets attached every 25 metres Because it moves in most cases the birds see it and fly over and don t collide Similar systems are being tested in the Netherlands and in Hungary and other locations but don t expect to see them soon on every power line There s a cost factor they won t put them up

is a great shame a piece of mountaineering folklore has disappeared Mr Mosedale said Back in May 2016 pictures posted by the American Himalayan Foundation appeared to show that the Hillary Step had changed shape But thanks to the snowfall it was hard to tell for sure This year with less snow it was clear the Step had gone It was reported last year and indeed I climbed it last year but we weren t sure for certain that The Step had gone because the area was blasted with snow Mr Mosedale wrote on Facebook He concluded This year however I can report that the chunk of rock named The Hillary Step is definitely not there any more Mr Mosedale who is due to go back up Everest later this month said he believed the Step was most likely a victim of Nepal s 2015 earthquake It could well just be gravity but I would suspect the earthquake was the cause he told the BBC Mountaineers claim the snow covered slope will be much easier to climb than the notorious rock face but have warned that it could create a bottleneck It is a serious worry for those already battling low oxygen and frostbite conditions at the top of the world Speaking to the BBC in 2012 British mountaineer Sir Chris

surface of Mars That s the conclusion of an inquiry into the failure on 16 October 2016 The report outlines failings during the development process and makes several recommendations ahead of a rover mission to Mars set for launch in 2020 That mission will require more testing improvements to software and more outside oversight of design choices The Schiaparelli module was intended to test the European Space Agency s Esa capability for atmospheric entry descent and finally landing on the surface of Mars The report confirms some details already released in the preliminary findings For example during the descent and after the parachute had been deployed a component called the inertial measurement unit IMU sensed rotational accelerations in the probe that were larger than expected This led to the IMU data becoming saturated When this information was integrated by the onboard guidance navigation and control GNC software the probe erroneously updated where it thought it was in the descent The mistaken measurement was propagated forward and at one point the GNC software calculated a negative altitude for the probe it thought that Schiaparelli was several metres below the surface of Mars even though it was still falling The descent thrusters turned off and the test module was destroyed as it slammed into the ground in Mars Meridiani Plain at a velocity of about 150 m s But the authors believe the craft could still have landed safely after the wrong handling of the IMU data if other checks and balances had been in place The report rules out a fault with the IMU itself and suggests a number of other root causes leading to the failure These include In order to ensure that lessons are learned before a joint Esa Russian Space Agency Roscosmos rover is sent to land on Mars the inquiry panel made several recommendations The report authors catalogue a series of necessary upgrades to onboard software as well as suggesting improvements to the modelling of parachute dynamics They also recommended a more stringent approach including better quality control during the procurement of equipment from suppliers Crucially the inquiry also recommends greater outside oversight of the design process for the upcoming rover mission by partner organisations with specific competencies These suggested partners include Nasa s Jet Propulsion Laboratory JPL which

de facto nature reserves for penguins For better or worse however the time has now come for their home to be demined reports Matthew Teller I m following a crunching gravel path leading up over a headland To one side stretches a sweeping curve of white sand backed by tussocky dunes the coarse grass mixed with a low growing plant bearing tartly sweet red berries that the locals call diddle dee But it s the sound that startles Overlaying the booming ocean is a comical honking noise coming from thousands of Magellanic penguins One guarding its burrow beside the path stretches its neck up at me then lets out an ear splitting wing waggling bray of displeasure I can see why these penguins are known locally as jackasses The beach also dotted with waddling clusters of Gentoo penguins looks tempting but between me and the birds stretches a barbed wire fence marked with signs warning of danger This is Yorke Bay just outside Stanley capital of the Falkland Islands Once a popular leisure beach it was here at 04 30 on the morning of 2 April 1982 that Argentine naval commandos landed marking the start of a full scale invasion By the time British forces retook Stanley 74 days later 907 people had lost their lives most of them Argentine conscripts During the occupation one of the Argentine military s first actions was to lay tens of thousands of land mines across the uncultivated countryside to slow a British counter attack especially a seaborne attack via the beaches around Stanley including Yorke Bay Fortunately the landmines aren t a problem for the penguins at least not the little Magellanics and Gentoos of Yorke Bay They don t seem to be heavy enough to set them off says Esther Bertram chief executive officer of Falklands Conservation Behind their fences shielded from human encroachment the penguins have had decades of peace and quiet in their minefield Native flora has regrown around them Natural systems have returned to not quite a pristine state but a state where you ve reached climax communities in certain parts says Paul Brickle director of the South Atlantic Environmental Research Institute The mines are horrible things and very difficult to remove you essentially have to get on your hands and knees to do that remove bits of earth and dunes and disrupt the ecosystem There s a bit of a trade off in thinking what are the benefits of having them removed he asks Initially at least not everyone in the islands tiny close knit population of 3 000 was supportive Falkland Islanders weren t enthused by the idea to put it bluntly says Barry Elsby a member of the Falklands Legislative Assembly We would rather have left the minefields as they were They are all clearly marked clearly fenced No civilian has ever been injured We said to the British government Don t spend the money here go to some other country where they have a much greater need to free up farming land Unfortunately Elsby adds the British government have signed up to the Ottawa convention which puts a duty on them to do this The 1997 Ottawa Mine Ban Treaty compels signatories which include the UK to clear minefields in territory under their control So whatever the locals and the penguins thought the mines had to go Since 2009 the British government has spent tens of millions of pounds on mine clearance in the Falklands Guy Marot of the Falkland Islands Demining Programme Office oversees a team of largely Zimbabwean operatives highly valued for their long experience of demining in their home country and further afield He takes me out to one of the clearance sites In a setting of wide open moorland battling gales and driving rain demining specialist Innocent Mudzamiri fully kitted out with protective clothing and visor explains how he approaches his job lying prone in the boggy peat painstakingly clearing dirt from around devices that could blow up in his face It s just caution You have to do it gently so that you don t disturb the mine he says Your mind must be free no thinking of home or thinking whatever but just concentrate So far Mudzamiri and his colleagues have cleared more than seven million square metres of mostly rough countryside But now Phase 5 of the demining programme is seeing sensitive sites of environmental concern such as Yorke Bay come up for clearance The Falkland Islands Government is part of the way through drawing up an environmental impact assessment examining the risks and benefits from demining wildlife rich sites Yorke Bay is particularly difficult since in 1982 mines were placed on top of the sand dunes but over 35 years the dunes have changed shape and shifted with the wind Even with the detailed charts handed over by Argentina to the UK after the war it s impossible now to know where the mines might be they could have drifted far from their original position or become buried deep below the surface The deminers are facing having to dig up the entire beach perhaps with armoured machinery and sift it all The idea is to do that during the winter while the penguins are out at sea But their habitat and the wider ecosystem could be entirely destroyed Another potential hazard is tourism a key driver of the Falklands economy About 50 000 people visit the islands annually most of them day trippers from cruise ships plying the waters around South America and Antarctica Each time a cruise ship docks hundreds of passengers at a time come ashore to see the wildlife If Yorke Bay is reopened its easy to reach location barely 10 minutes drive from Stanley could make it a magnet for tourist traffic Another source of worry comes from the locals Most beaches in the Falklands are on private land But Yorke Bay is publicly owned and opening it up could revive its pre war status as one of Stanley s most popular getaways There are already concerns about quad biking and livestock grazing on public land outside the Yorke Bay fences Whether the rejuvenated land within the minefield could be protected when the fences come down remains uncertain In 2010 Marot oversaw the clearance of Surf Bay another beach near Stanley which held 1 800 mines Today as locals ramble over dunes and on to its sandy beach to walk their dogs it s hard to discern the damage that was done The re establishment is remarkable says Marot The processes used at the time included blowing up the anti tank mines in situ The holes here were 10m deep in some places this was a moonscape But then we put all the sand back on top and tried to do it in a way that would allow nature to eventually recover completely which is what you see now So the Falklands is facing a head on clash between the obligation to clear mines and the imperative for environmental conservation Meanwhile the honking jackasses behind the Yorke Bay fences are thriving ironically because of one of the worst things humanity can do start a war matthewteller Join the conversation find us on Facebook Instagram Snapchat and Twitter", "Share this with Email

substance under the South China Sea considered key to future global energy supply Chinese authorities have described the success as a major breakthrough Methane hydrates also called flammable ice hold vast reserves of natural gas Many countries including the US and Japan are working on how to tap those reserves but mining and extracting are extremely difficult The catchy phrase describes a frozen mixture of water and gas It looks like ice crystals but if you zoom in to a molecular level you see that the methane molecules are caged in by the water molecules Associate Professor Praveen Linga from the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the National University of Singapore told the BBC Officially known as methane clathrates or hydrates they are formed at very low temperatures and under high pressure They can be found in sediments under the ocean floor as well as underneath permafrost on land Despite the low temperature these hydrates are flammable If you hold a lighter to them the gas encapsulated in the ice will catch fire Hence they are also known as fire ice or flammable ice By lowering the pressure or raising the temperature the hydrates break down into water and methane a lot of methane One cubic metre of the compound releases about 160 cubic metres of gas making it a highly energy intensive fuel The crux though is that extracting the gas is extremely difficult and energy consuming Methane hydrates were discovered in Russia s north in the 1960s but research into how to extract gas from them from maritime sediment only began in the last 10 to 15 years As a country lacking any natural energy resources Japan has been a pioneer in the field Other leading countries are India or South Korea who also don t have their own oil reserves While the US and Canada are also active in the field they have been focussing on hydrates under permafrost in the far north of Alaska and Canada Methane hydrates are thought to have the potential to be a revolutionary energy source that could be key to future energy needs likely the world s last great source of carbon based fuel Vast deposits exist basically underneath all oceans around the the globe especially on the edge of continental shelves Countries are scrambling for a way to make the extraction safe and profitable China describes its latest results as a breakthrough and Mr Linga agrees Compared with the results we have seen from Japanese research the Chinese scientists have managed to extract much more gas in their efforts So in that sense it is indeed a major step towards making gas extraction from methane hydrates viable It s thought that there is as much as 10 times the amount of gas in methane hydrates than in shale for instance And that s by conservative estimates says Prof Linga China discovered flammable ice in the South China Sea in 2007 Nestled between between China Vietnam and the Philippines the South China Sea has in recent years been an increasingly contentious issue with Beijing claiming sole sovereignty over it and hence rights to all natural reserves hidden under its surface While indeed a breakthrough China s success is still only one step on a long journey Prof Linga explains It is the first time that production rates actually seem promising he says But it s thought that only by 2025 at the earliest we might be able to look at realistic commercial options An average of 16 000 cubic meters of gas with high purity have been extracted per day in the Shenhu area of the South China Sea according to Chinese media But Mr Linga also cautions that any exploitation of the reserves must be done with the utmost care because of environmental concerns The potential threat is that methane can escape which would have serious consequences for global warming It is a gas that has a much higher potential to impact climate change than carbon dioxide So the trick is to extract the gas without any of it slipping out", "Share this with Email

spread of a deadly parasitic disease They say the information will help in the fight against schistosomiasis an infection caused by a parasitic worm that lives in streams and ponds The disease affects millions of people a year in sub tropical and tropical regions More than 100 researchers from around the world have unlocked the DNA secrets of a snail that transmits the parasite They say it will help in the understanding of the snail s biology including new ways to stop the parasite spreading to people Having the knowledge means we can progress at a much faster pace at understanding the disease and reducing the number of people infected said Dr Joanna Bridger of the University of Brunel a co researcher on the study The snail Biomphalaria glabrata is found in South America Related snails are responsible for transmitting the parasite in sub Saharan Africa where most cases occur People become infected when larval forms of the parasite released by freshwater snails penetrate the skin in contaminated water In the body the larvae develop into adult worms which live in the blood vessels and release eggs Some of the eggs are passed out of the body to continue the parasite s lifecycle Others become trapped in body tissues causing damage to organs There is no vaccine for schistosomiasis and current control measures involve mass administration of the drug praziquantel Scientists now hope to develop new treatments perhaps by disrupting the snail s mating habits The information will also be useful in tracking snail populations that differ in how they transmit the parasites This work provides several inroads for control of Biomphalaria snails to reduce risks of schistosome re infection of endemic human populations an important component of the WHO strategy aimed at elimination of the global health risks posed by schistosomiasis said the researchers in the journal Nature Communications The research was led by Prof Coen Adema from the University of New

developed a serious gut infection that would have killed me if it hadn t been for antibiotics These days a young child in India with the same condition would be far more vulnerable because of the huge and rapid rise in antibiotic resistance in that part of the world The problem is not of course confined to India It s estimated that antibiotic resistant infections currently kill at least 700 000 people a year This is projected to rise to 10 million by 2050 What is particularly worrying is that as well as the emergence of antibiotic resistance and the threat it poses there have been no new classes of antibiotics released in the past 30 years I wanted to make a documentary that explores the reasons behind the rise of the superbugs and what progress is being made to find new ways to counter them The producer of the documentary Peter Gauvain was keen to expose me to some of the more unpleasant superbugs around and then see if we could treat them Since this was clearly unwise we compromised by creating life size models of my head and body out of a nutrient rich jelly called agar We used my body doubles whom we dubbed Microbial Michael to experiment on The results were fascinating and rather disturbing We started by swabbing my real body and then wiping these microbes on to my body double The right hand side of Microbial Michael had previously been saturated with a powerful broad spectrum antibiotic How long would the antibiotic hold the bacteria at bay Answer not long at all Within days both sides of my body had become a battlefield of competing microbes some of them quite nasty pathogens So what about novel treatments The encouraging thing is that we did come across a number of different approaches to fighting the threat of antibiotic resistance that were promising One of the oldest approaches which in the West is only now coming back into fashion is the use of viruses to attack bacteria Just as we are prone to viral infections such as the common cold so are bacteria The viruses that infect and kill bacteria are known as bacteriophages or phages It s been estimated there are more than 10 million trillion trillion phages around which is more than every other organism on Earth combined Phages were first discovered more than a century ago and have been used to treat bacterial infections in a number of specialised centres in Central and Eastern Europe ever since There s a clinic in Poland where they use phage therapy on patients who have infections that are resistant to every known antibiotic There we met a woman called Boguslawo who had developed an infection in her leg after stepping on a rusty nail which neither antibiotics nor conventional therapy could heal Faced with the choice of trying phages or having her leg amputated she put her faith in the phages and so far that faith seems to be justified Dr Alex Betts of Oxford University is one of a handful of scientists in the UK currently working with phages and he kindly agreed to demonstrate their effectiveness by infecting my agar double with a superbug called pseudomonas This causes septicaemia an infection of the blood and pneumonia both of which can be fatal In short it s nasty He swabbed my agar face with a multi drug resistant strain of pseudomonas and then covered part of it with a small bandage impregnated with phages Some time later when we examined my infected face under ultraviolet light it was clear that the phages had done their work All the rest of the face had been colonised by pseudomonas apart from the small patch where he had put the phage bandage There have been no proper clinical trials of phage therapy in the UK yet so they won t be seen outside of the lab any time soon But I m convinced that these viruses are packed with potential As Dr Betts explained one of the great advantages of phage therapy is there is less risk of bacteria developing resistance Phages need to infect bacteria in order to survive he said And if antibiotic resistance evolves they can co evolve rapidly They re not going to replace antibiotics but there are certain roles that they can fill that will ease the pressure on our existing therapeutics buy us time to develop new antimicrobials And phages can certainly be used alongside antibiotics As well as phages we also tried infecting and then treating my body double with a novel antibiotic derived from ants discovered by Prof Matt Hutchings and his team at the University of East Anglia This time we infected my face with the superbug MRSA methycyliin resistant staph aureus which I m pleased to say the ant antibiotic was able to fight off Prof Hutchings is cautiously excited about their discovery as he is well aware that developing new drugs is hugely expensive and can take a great deal of time And with a potential antibiotic apocalypse approaching fast time is not on our side Michael Mosley vs The Superbugs is on BBC Four on Wednesday 17 May at 21 00 BST Join the conversation on our

Nasa s science mission directorate We want the community to be prepared for this announcement of opportunity because Nasa recognises the immense amount of work involved in preparing proposals for this potential future exploration The announcement is intended to provide notice of a two step competition for experiments Science teams are expected to put together proposals which would be evaluated by experts working for Nasa About 10 proposals could be selected to go forward to the next stage Last year in response to a congressional directive Nasa outlined its concept for how a landing mission would work The report calls for a four legged lander that would hunt for evidence of microbial life on Europa s surface It would touch down with the help of the Sky Crane system used to deliver the Curiosity rover to Mars in 2012 but would use a much longer tether to minimise contamination of the Europan surface with rocket fuel The lander would carry some heritage from Nasa s Phoenix lander which touched down in Mars arctic in May 2008 That mission used a motorised cutting tool called a rasp to break up the hard icy soil along with a scooper to retrieve the samples for analysis The Europa lander will carry a counter rotating saw in addition to Phoenix s flight tested rasp and scoop Scientists want to dig at least 10cm below the radiation processed ice but comparatively little is known about Europa s surface properties With temperatures that dip to 170C however engineers have to prepare for the eventuality of steel hard ice that resists Nasa s best efforts to dig through However scientists believe that if there is any life near the surface they could detect it at concentrations of at least 100 microbial cells per cubic centimetre of ice Although Europa s icy outer shell is thought to be tens of kilometres thick studying the surface could provide clues to what s going on deep below Warm blobs of ice or diapirs could well up from the ocean ice shell interface eventually reaching the surface over thousands of years carrying any evidence of microbial life with them Earlier this year Nasa programme scientist Curt Niebur told me The lander is all about hitting the freshest most pristine sample possible One way to do that is to dig deep another way is going to where there is some kind of eruption on the surface like a plume that s dropping very fresh material onto the surface The Hubble telescope has provided tentative evidence for geysers that spew ice out into space from deep beneath Europa s surface The lander would follow several years after a

birth control activist who urged scientists to develop it wanted to liberate women sexually and socially to put them on a more equal footing with men But the pill wasn t just socially revolutionary It also sparked an economic revolution perhaps the most significant economic change of the late 20th Century 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions ideas and innovations which

programme podcast To see why first consider what the pill offered to women For a start it worked unlike many of the other options Over the centuries lovers have tried all kinds of unappealing tricks to prevent pregnancy There was crocodile dung in ancient Egypt Aristotle s recommendation of cedar oil and Casanova s method of using half a lemon as a cervical cap But even the obvious modern alternative to the pill condoms have a failure rate Because people don t tend to use them exactly as they re supposed to they sometimes rip or slip So for every 100 sexually active women using condoms for a year 18 will become pregnant The failure rate of the sponge is similar The diaphragm isn t much better But the failure rate of the pill with typical use is just 6 three times safer than condoms Used perfectly the failure rate drops to one twentieth of that Using a condom meant negotiating with a partner The diaphragm and sponge were messy But the decision to use the pill was a woman s and it was private and discreet No wonder women wanted it The pill was first approved in the United States in 1960 In just five years almost half of married women on birth control were using it But the real revolution would come when unmarried women got access to oral contraceptives That took time But in around 1970 10 years after the pill was first approved US state after US state started to make it easier for single women to get the pill Universities opened family planning centres By the mid 1970s the pill was overwhelmingly the most popular form of contraception for 18 and 19 year old women in the US And that was when the economic revolution really began Women in America started studying particular kinds of degrees law medicine dentistry and MBAs which had previously been very masculine In 1970 medical degrees were over 90 male Law degrees and MBAs were over 95 male Dentistry degrees were 99 male But at the beginning of the 1970s equipped with the pill women surged into all these courses At first women made up a fifth of the class then a quarter By 1980 they often made up a third This wasn t simply because women became more likely to go to university Women who d already decided to be students opted for these professional courses The proportion of female students studying subjects such as medicine and law rose dramatically and logically enough the presence of women in the professions rose sharply shortly afterwards But what did this have to do with the pill By giving women control over their fertility it allowed them to invest in their careers Before the pill was available taking five years or more to qualify as a doctor or lawyer didn t look like a good use of time and money To reap the benefits of those courses a woman would need to be able to reliably delay motherhood until she was 30 at least Having a baby at the wrong time risked derailing her studies or delaying her professional progress A sexually active woman who tried to become a doctor dentist or lawyer was doing the equivalent of building a factory in an earthquake zone just one bit of bad luck and the expensive investment would be trashed Of course women could simply abstain from sex if they wanted to study for a professional career But many didn t want to And it wasn t just about having fun It was also about finding a husband Before the pill people married young A woman who decided to abstain from sex while developing her career might try to find a husband at the age of 30 and find that quite literally all the good men had been taken The pill changed both those dynamics It meant that unmarried women could have sex with substantially less risk of an unwanted pregnancy But it also changed the whole pattern of marriage Everyone started to marry later even women who didn t use the pill Babies started to arrive later and at a time of women s own choosing And that meant that women at least had time to establish a professional career Of course many other things changed for American women in the 1970s Abortion was legalised laws against sex discrimination were put in place feminism emerged as a movement and the drafting of young men to fight in Vietnam forced employers to recruit more women But a careful statistical study by the Harvard economists Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz strongly suggests that the pill must have played a major role in allowing women to delay marriage and motherhood and invest in their own careers Goldin and Katz tracked the availability of the pill to young women in the US state by state They show that as each state opened up access to contraception so the enrolment rate in professional courses soared and so did women s wages Grace Hopper s compiler Computing s hidden hero How economics killed the antibiotic dream Rise of the robots What advances mean for workers Superstar economics How the gramophone changed everything A few years ago the economist Amalia Miller used a variety of clever statistical methods to demonstrate that if a woman in her 20s was able to delay motherhood by one year her lifetime earnings would rise by 10 That was some measure of the vast advantage to a woman of completing her studies and securing her career before having children But the young women of the 1970s didn t need to see Amalia Miller s research they already knew it was true As the pill became available they signed up for long professional courses in undreamt of numbers American women today can look across the Pacific Ocean for a vision of an alternative reality In Japan one of the world s most technologically advanced societies the pill wasn t approved for use until 1999 Japanese women had to wait 39 years longer than their American counterparts for the same contraceptive In contrast when the erection boosting drug Viagra was approved in the US Japan was just a few months behind Gender inequality in Japan is widely reckoned to be worse than anywhere else in the developed world with women continuing to struggle for recognition in the workplace It is impossible to disentangle cause and effect here but the experience in the US suggests that it is no coincidence Delay the pill by two generations and of course

with the demise of the dinosaurs summarise their findings so far in a BBC Two documentary on Monday The researchers recovered rocks from under the Gulf of Mexico that were hit by an asteroid 66 million years ago The nature of this material records the details of the event It is becoming clear that the 15km wide asteroid could not have hit a worse place on Earth The shallow sea covering the target site meant colossal volumes of sulphur from the mineral gypsum were injected into the atmosphere extending the global winter period that followed the immediate firestorm Had the asteroid struck a different location the outcome might have been very different This is where we get to the great irony of the story because in the end it wasn t the size of the asteroid the scale of blast or even its global reach that made dinosaurs extinct it was where the impact happened said Ben Garrod who presents The Day The Dinosaurs Died with Alice Roberts Had the asteroid struck a few moments earlier or later rather than hitting shallow coastal waters it might have hit deep ocean An impact in the nearby Atlantic or Pacific oceans would have meant much less vaporised rock including the deadly gypsum The cloud would have been less dense and sunlight could still have reached the planet s surface meaning what happened next might have been avoided In this cold dark world food ran out of the oceans within a week and shortly after on land With nothing to eat anywhere on the planet the mighty dinosaurs stood little chance of survival Ben Garrod spent time on the drill rig that was stationed 30km off Mexico s Yucatan Peninsula in April May last year to better understand the aims of the project Alice Roberts visited widely separated fossil beds in the Americas to get a sense of how life was upended by the impact Rock cores from up to 1 300m beneath the Gulf were recovered The lowest sections of this material come from a feature within the crater called the peak ring This is made from rock that has been heavily fractured and altered by immense pressures By analysing its properties the drill project team led by Profs Jo Morgan and Sean Gulick hope to reconstruct how the impact proceeded and the environmental changes it brought about Chicxulub Crater The impact that changed life on Earth They know now the energy that went into making the crater when the asteroid struck equivalent to 10 billion Hiroshima A bombs And they also understand how the depression assumed the structure we observe today The team is also gaining insights into the return of life to the impact site in the years after the event One of the many fascinating sequences in the BBC Two programme sees Alice Roberts visit a quarry in New Jersey US where 25 000 fossil fragments have been recovered evidence of a mass die off of creatures that may have been among the casualties on the day of the impact itself All these fossils occur in a layer no more than 10cm thick palaeontologist Ken Lacovara

first step in an emerging market launching cheap disposable rockets to carry small satellites and other payloads The company plans to start frequent commercial launches later this year Poor weather conditions had pushed the launch into the fourth day of a 10 day window and the Electron finally cleared its pad at 16 20 local time 04 20 GMT The launch was conducted with no media or spectators permitted but the company released a video of the lift off on its Twitter page It was a great flight chief executive Peter Beck said in a statement after the launch adding though that the rocket did not quite reach orbit the path on which its future cargo would embark on its revolution of the Earth We ll be investigating why however reaching space in our first test puts us in an incredibly strong position to accelerate the commercial phase of our programme deliver our customers to orbit and make space open for business The test launch one of three planned did not carry a payload as such although it was packed with sensor equipment to help engineers understand how the flight performed Eventually Rocket Lab says it will be lofting payloads up to 150kg 331lbs into a 500km high orbits that go from pole to pole We re on the cusp of something quite exciting Innovative companies are packaging really capable technologies into very small low cost satellites Their data will drive myriad new services from helping city officials keep track of urban development to giving farmers information about the performance of their crops But if this new wave is to succeed it needs cheaper access to space At the moment the economics and flight schedules of these small satellites are still being defined by the availability and price of a ride on a big rocket Rocket Lab aims to change that And there are others such as Richard Branson s LauncherOne project Rocket Lab s second vehicle is already built and set to fly in the next couple of months Keep an eye on the end of the year too because this US NZ outfit even has a contract to send a small lander to the Moon Rocket Lab s founder and chief executive Peter Beck is from New Zealand and the firm has a New Zealand subsidiary The country has less air traffic compared to say the US so there is less need for flights to be rerouted every time a rocket is sent to space New Zealand is also positioned well to get satellites into a north to south orbit around Earth The trajectory takes the rocket out over open water far from from people and property The country hopes these favourable factors will help it become a low cost space hub Nice touch The Electron has nine engines on its first stage and one engine on its second stage They are called Rutherford engines after the great New Zealand born physicist Ernest Rutherford 1871 1937 who famously split the atom in 1917 Private and commercial rocket launches are becoming more and more common the most famous example being Elon Musk and his SpaceX Falcon rockets But the SpaceX vehicles are huge and are aimed at following in the footsteps of Nasa missions delivering cargo to the international space station and eventually sending people to Mars Rocket Lab s goal is to launch what by comparison is a tiny rocket for a fraction of the price but with much more frequency The Electron is a mere 17m long and 1 2m in diameter Each launch only costs about 5m Rocket Lab wants to conduct 50 or more a year Just to put this all into perspective SpaceX s current Falcon rocket is a towering 70m and can carry 22 800kg into low Earth orbit for a standard price of 62m Rocket Lab s website already allows you to book a slot for your satellite The cheapest deal is a small cubesat on a rideshare option prices start at 77 000 59 280", "Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger

by a rocket bolted to a Eurofighter Typhoon jet engine the vehicle will first mount an assault on the world land speed record 763mph 1 228km h Bloodhound should start running on Hakskeen Pan in Northern Cape South Africa in 2018 Work continues as we prepare Bloodhound SSC to run at Newquay later on this year While it s tempting to become frustrated about how long this is taking a recent comment by an independent project management company put it in perspective for me They observed that getting to 1 000mph is right at the limit of human technical achievement which tells me two things The first is that we ve probably chosen the right target for our Engineering Adventure to showcase cutting edge technology to a global audience The second is that going to the limit of human achievement is supposed to take time at least if you re going to do it properly One of the key bits of work recently has been the installation and testing of Bloodhound s power steering system This raises a wider question about why you need steering at all if you re only driving in straight line The great Malcolm Campbell once described driving along Daytona Beach back in 1933 as follows I had one hell of a job keeping the car on course At 272mph Campbell was doing just over a quarter of Bloodhound SSC s planned top speed More recently while we were busy setting the current supersonic world record in Thrust SSC I found things similarly challenging with up to 90 degrees of steering lock required at over 600mph So when it comes to Bloodhound we re not taking anything for granted If you want more detail on the difficulties of high speed steering have a look at How hard can it be to drive in a straight line The steering has to cope with surface irregularities which may look small but feel big at supersonic speeds and the effect of cross winds which are a fact of life on record breaking tracks that are many miles long The car s aerodynamic performance and stability will also play a huge part This is why Thrust SSC was such a handful back in 1997 before the technology really existed to understand the likely effects of trying to drive supersonic Even with the incredible sophistication of Bloodhound s technology it s a reasonable assumption that at some point we re going to need to work at keeping the car straight The steering is obviously a key piece of safety equipment so it s designed to be as simple and reliable as possible We re using a mechanical rack and pinion system where the steering column turns a gear wheel or pinion that drives a toothed rod or rack back and forth to steer the front wheels This is the system that just about every road car in the world uses so it s well proven There are of course a few differences between a normal road car and steering Bloodhound SSC The mass of the car for instance fully fuelled Bloodhound SSC is likely to weigh in at about eight tonnes Then there s the size of the wheels which at 90cm about 3ft in diameter are not exactly small The wheels are also heavy about 100kg each and will rotate at up to 10 000 revs minute That will produce some large gyroscopic loads if you haven t experienced this then grab a bicycle lift the front wheel off the ground spin the wheel as fast as you can and then turn the handle bars you ll find the bike s steering has become quite stiff Multiply that effect by a large number and something similar happens in a land speed record car As well as the gyroscopic forces the car s front wheels will be travelling at supersonic speeds over the ground which will create some significant rolling resistance surface drag forces All of these forces will be changing continuously as the car runs The net result will be well so complex that we can t really predict it precisely but it s a safe bet that the suspension is going to see some big loads This is likely to make the steering very heavy at times which is where the power assistance comes in It s not that I can t steer the car using the mechanical system alone but the power assistance will make it physically easier and therefore should help to make it more precise At 1 000mph that s a good thing The power assistance is an electrical system which is run from the essential services battery This is an aircrew term I haven t got the rest of the team using it yet but leave it with me for the key things that you need to work even if you have a power failure elsewhere From my point of view as the driver essential services are the steering the radio the Rolex back up speedo and the fire systems These will have their own separate electrical supply to make them as reliable as possible If the worst does happen and we somehow have a total power failure then the mechanical steering will still allow me to stop the car safely from any speed even without power assistance The other thing that power assistance could offer is some form of automated steering or computer stabilisation at high speeds However we will definitely not be doing this for a couple of very good reasons The first is that the rules do not allow it and quite right too in my opinion In order to be a land vehicle in LSR terms the FIA rules require that the vehicle is wholly and continuously controlled by the driver Even if the rules did allow for a computer stabilisation system should we really be running a car that needs a computer system which will be untested in this prototype vehicle to keep it safe And if we don t need it then why fit it As previously mentioned we ve already got plenty of things to do While we re getting the car ready to run this year s schools rocket car competition is coming to a climax As you read this the last of the regional finals have just finished with the national final planned for Santa Pod Raceway in June I m delighted to say that the Army and more recently the RAF have been supporting the competition helping thousands of young students to experience the excitement of

500 model rocket car kits to American schools recently Our global Adventure really is going global If you have a couple of minutes to spare have a look at the video from Hudson City School District Ohio It s been put together by one of our sponsors Swagelok and it s lovely My highlight is the teacher talking about a class discussion on Bloodhound We had a phenomenal discussion they talked about things that just blew my mind If it s having that effect on the teacher just think about how this is grabbing the kids attention I love this project This month s May Day Extravaganza at the Bloodhound Technical Centre gave a huge audience the chance to see the latest work on the car plus some new and unusual Bloodhound related competitions The kids make a vegetable Bloodhound car competition

next week having apparently shrugged off pressure from US allies in recent days The US president tweeted he would make his final decision on the Paris accord after his return to Washington Mr Trump left the G7 summit in Sicily on Saturday without reaffirming his commitment to the accord unlike the other six world leaders in attendance He previously threatened to pull out Mr Trump who has called climate change a hoax on occasion has reportedly indicated this is still his position to key members of his inner circle The uncertainty over his position on the Paris agreement puts him at odds with other members of the G7 The Paris deal is the world s first comprehensive climate agreement set out in 2015 with the aim of keeping the global average rise in temperatures below 2C In order to do that countries pledged to reduce their carbon emissions But it came into force only after being ratified by 55 countries which between them produce 55 of global carbon emissions Barack Obama signed the US up in September 2016 and members of the G7 are keen for the US to continue to back it not least because the country is the second largest emitter of greenhouse gasses after China Mr Trump told voters on the campaign trail he wanted to scrap agreements contrary to the national interest while repeatedly promising to strengthen the coal industry Coal power is a major contributor to carbon emissions However Mr Trump wants to boost coal production to create more jobs He has also expressed doubt about the causes of climate change saying it is a hoax made up by China The Axios news site suggests Mr Trump is leaning that way currently citing three sources who say his mind is made up and that the wheels are quietly being put in motion behind the scenes This is despite US defence secretary James Mattis saying in an interview to air on Sunday that the president is now wide open on the issue Withdrawal would risk making Mr Trump unpopular not only with his allies abroad but also with activists at home It was noted his attitude to climate change was one of the major hurdles during the summit in Sicily the first time he has met his fellow G7 leaders as a group His stance left him isolated with Mr Trump s reluctance to reaffirm his commitment clearly annoying German chancellor Angela Merkel who told reporters The entire discussion about climate was very difficult if not to say very dissatisfying There are fears the US pulling out may lead to other smaller countries following suit Even if they do not as the US has such a large carbon footprint it will mean the impact of the agreement will likely be lessened significantly Whatever the US chooses the EU India and China say they will stick to their pledges made in Paris And what s more some of Mr Trump s own country is likely to ignore his scepticism New York and California have already pledged to combat climate change without the Trump administration s support", "Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger

a state of emergency has been declared there The island has about 200 residents who rely on agriculture and fishing Locust infestation is a recurring problem A member of the local administration Stella Spanou told the BBC that sheep were starving as so much vegetation was being devoured by the locust swarms Students from Athens have sprayed the pesticides diflubenzuron and spinosad It s difficult because of the landscape they have to go on foot The eco friendly chemicals are working they got good results Ms Spanou said But there are still many locusts because they couldn t spray everywhere The students from the Agricultural University of Athens sprayed under the expert supervision of scientists They got a special government permit for the pesticides because those chemicals were not registered for use against locusts team leader Antonios Tsagkarakis told the BBC The island 30km 19 miles south of Limnos has one village where vegetable gardens are being destroyed by the locusts The chemicals cannot be used in the village Ms Spanou said Agios Efstratios is part of the EU s Natura 2000 conservation network it has a special status because of its rare flora and fauna The island is not a big tourist destination By July August most of the locusts will have disappeared Ms Spanou said but the problem is that they keep coming back The swarms are not thought to be migratory Next year Mr Tsagkarakis said the Athens students will use a geographic information system GIS and drones to help fight the locusts Read more on locusts The Greek island s caves cliffs and pools provide habitats for monk seals falcons seabirds and migratory birds The island s important vegetation includes rare Valonia oak Quercus macrolepis sea daffodils Pancratium maritimum and extensive seagrass beds Posidonia oceanica Many times we asked the government to declare an emergency but it is expensive to do so They acted this time because the problem is really big It means we can overcome bureaucratic problems and do things much quicker Ms Spanou said Compensation for the islanders perhaps in the form of a tax deduction is under discussion", "Share this with Email Facebook Messenger

research has suggested A paper in the journal Atmospheric Environment says tall trees are good at absorbing pollution in more open areas But hedges can trap toxins at exhaust pipe level so reduce people s direct exposure to harmful pollutants Lead author Prof Prashant Kumar said councils should try to plant low hedges between pedestrians and the street if pavements are wide enough He and his partners in the EU and US are still researching the best pollution busting plants and the optimum height for the hedge But any gardener in a major city who has trimmed a privet hedge for instance will attest that it is full of dust and pollutants that the tight knit foliage has filtered from the air The authors of the report are not anti trees far from it They say trees help clean the air and many more should be planted as people worldwide flood into cities But they say the role of the hedge has been neglected especially in city canyons where tall trees can in some circumstances trap pollution at street level There is they insist no hard and fast rule about the best planting for any given area it will depend upon local conditions Dr Kumar of Surrey University told BBC News The big thing about hedges is that they are right down at tailpipe level The emissions from vehicles starts to dilute very quickly as you move away from the road so any hedge that acts as a barrier slowing down the airflow and catching pollutants on the leaves is going to offer people in homes better protection The paper comes as cash strapped councils round the UK are starting to charge households for

scientists today learn more about the impact of climate change BBC News has had exclusive access to the films Among them is the first aerial footage of the top of Mount Everest It was shot in 1933 by Major Latham Valentine Stewart Blacker a former fighter pilot and war hero He was a real life Biggles Blacker and his friends risked their lives flying in specially built biplanes higher than anyone had flown before to capture historic footage Alasdair MacLeod who is in charge of the project for the RGS says that the film is one of more than a hundred in the RGS s possession that will be put online this year The society has a collection of over two million items It s the world s largest collection of geographically related maps photographs artefacts diaries notebooks and publications And this film collection which has been housed at the British Film Institute s national archive for many years has not been made more accessible But it has now The most shocking is the earliest known footage of Tibet shot in 1922 It was taken by an army officer Captain John Noel on the first ever attempt to reach the top of Mount Everest He filmed a scene at a monastery on the way to Everest where the climbers seek a blessing from the monks They are treated as honoured guests and shown ritual dances telling stories of reincarnation Around the dancers waists are aprons made from a lattice of human bones their face masks are made from stretched human skin Captain Noel s daughter Sandra told me that the attempt to climb Everest was like the Moon landings at that time This was going to be a world event and it captured the imagination People had just emerged from the war They were impoverished and had very little to be excited about And here was this expedition to Mount Everest Captain Noel s footage is of scientific as well as historical value It will be used by researchers to compare with current images to help them assess the impact climate change has had on the Himalayas over the past 100 years In 1932 cinema audiences were amazed to see the exploits of another young army officer Ralph Bagnold journeying thousands of miles across the Libyan Desert in a car When one of the cars broke down it was cannibalised for spare parts and abandoned And they are still out there somewhere buried among the dunes The vehicles would often get stuck in the sand and each time Bagnold and his team would find ever more ingenious ways of extricating them It seems like an odd thing to do now but Bagnold and his friends risked their lives on this expedition because they saw it as a great challenge so says the adventurer s son Stephen The experts proclaimed it couldn t be done To dad that was the greatest possible spur not that he wanted to show that he was the master or anything like that but just because it tickled his fancy and that maybe with clear planning and with the right equipment there could be a way of crossing the desert Stephen told BBC News Bagnold took careful measurements during his expedition to understand how the sand is moved by the wind He published several research papers on the subject His work would later help the American and European space agencies explore Mars His insights are being used to design rovers that can cross Martian sand without getting stuck Thousands of miles away in Yemen a pilot Aubery Rickards filmed the Hadhramaut a region that is home to an ancient civilization The film shows startling scenes of a dense collection of skyscrapers made from mud that were built in the 16th Century Some are 11 stories high They are still inhabited to this day It was in this area that people first learned how to live in concentrated environments It is sometimes referred to as the Manhattan of the desert Perhaps the most inspirational films are those shot by two young explorers George Sherriff and Frank Ludlow in the 1930s during their journeys through Bhutan and Tibet The two friends thought they had discovered paradise among the Himalayan mountains They filmed scenes of a simpler way of life where people were happy healthy and lived to a ripe old age The early colour films reinforce a sense they had found a brighter more hopeful world a contrast to the grim desolation of Europe after the First World War according to Prof Mike Heffernan of Nottingham University When Sherriff and Ludlow began their

track down their long lost relatives Julia recently helped Robert Weston who was found in a ladies toilet in an Odeon cinema in Birmingham in 1956 find his half brothers and sister for the first time Many of her cases involve American soldiers or GIs who were stationed in the UK during World War Two she says Indeed Julia says she is approached by someone who has discovered their father was in fact an American GI about once a month More children were fathered by American servicemen than many people imagine she says Julia is also currently helping a woman who as a baby was left in a box at London s Kings Cross railway station while another case involves a baby left on a train in 1928 So how does it work It starts with a spit test a DNA test which I get people to do Julia says That s sent away for testing She then uses uses three direct to consumer DNA databases to cross reference the data and then the detective work begins Julia who currently is not charging clients says she begins looking at patterns within the database to try and establish matches She then uses contacts around the world to try to identify relatives however distant they may be When Robert Weston contacted her 61 years after being abandoned in a cinema he said he had been searching for a long long time 44 years or so without success Julia asked him to provide a DNA saliva test and searched on the database in the hope of finding a distant relative There will be somebody on there fourth cousins or something for nearly everyone out there she explains Initially there were more distant matches but Julia was able to find and test a second cousin I asked her if she had any male cousins and she said Tommy Robert explains He agreed to be tested and he turned out to be my half brother But he says You need a huge dollop of luck with all this On occasion it is possible to trace relatives even further back The Salvation Army s family tracing service has reunited relatives who have been out of touch for more than 80 years It says it reunites 10 people every single working day with an 89 success rate It also protects the privacy of the person being sought by promising it will not pass on personal details unless permission is granted Julia says while most cases can eventually be solved a small number will permanently draw a blank Even then she says a person can get some information including an estimate about their ethnicity But she says as DNA databases increase in size the odds of closer matches get better all the time Julia has no genetics background saying you instead need to be smart and logical and know how to work with data I have a knowledge of science but my background was in teaching in Singapore she says My mother didn t know who her father was and that s how I got into this helping to look for her dad She adds I found someone in the states US who works in ancestry who helped show me how to do this She helped me with seeing the patterns and using my intuition She put the pieces together and I realised I was good at this My mum found her father had died four years earlier But she had a sister and now she s in touch with her family in the south of the US Where there is a success she says third parties are generally positive when they find out they have relatives they never knew although cases of abandoned babies can be very sensitive I might not always be the one to break the news sometimes it could be a social worker A running theme however is that many long lost relatives despite their different upbringings often share habits or interests One set of people I matched

ways to speed up the discovery and classification of plants to help safeguard them for future generations The second annual assessment of the State of the World s Plants by scientists at Kew found that 1 730 plants were recorded as being new to science in 2016 They include 11 new species from Brazil of the Manihot shrub known for its starchy root cassava Seven species of the South African plant best known for red bush or rooibos tea were discovered of which six are already threatened with extinction Other discoveries include new relatives of Aloe Vera widely used in the cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries Prof Kathy Willis director of science at the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew said the new discoveries hold huge promise for the future It s really important to find these new species because they may well hold the genetic code or the key to more resilient food crops from pests and pathogens and climate change into the future she said If we lose those crops or plants that provide really important natural capital for human well being so for example plants that draw down atmospheric carbon dioxide plants that maintain and enhance our soils plants that are important for fuel for medicines for fuels if we lose those that s the end of humanity Researchers at Kew are trying to identify which plants are most at risk of extinction by looking at the global distribution of plants and the identification and naming of new species The knowledge is being used to designate protected areas for plants around the world including several in Africa Kew s seed conservation project

nurseries at Kew are the last of their kind in the world We have about 10 000 species here 29 of which are natural source so that means they ve been collected from the wild she said That makes them

rocks But the analysis showed the team could get a very close match between the pixelated birds in the space images and the nests that were recorded in the ground truth data There tends to be a slight over counting which the team puts down to breeding partners or non breeding birds also being captured in a satellite scene Applying the technique at the Chatham Islands the team counted just over 3 600 nests This is slightly down on a manual count of 5 700 that was made in 2009 Dr Fretwell said The breeding numbers we counted were much lower than we anticipated which could show us that the population is declining or it could show just that we had a particularly poor year But this illustrates why you have to do this over several years and doing it by satellite is going be a lot cheaper and more efficient Dr Paul Scofield at Canterbury Museum NZ is a co author on the Ibis paper He described the difficulty of counting the birds in the traditional way at the group of stacks known as the Forty Fours The 44s are particularly tricky he told BBC News I once waited a whole month on the main Chatham Island for the weather to clear so I could land Even if you use a plane it s a problem as planes are only available infrequently and the wind and cloud prevent flying Then if you take photos you have to count them That can take 100s of hours This technology still requires the satellite to be in the right place and no cloud but it is certainly cheaper and more reliable Like the other five species of great albatross Northern Royals are under pressure for a variety of reasons Commercial fishing has depleted the stocks on which these seabirds also feed and the baited longline gear used by some vessels has an unpleasant knack for attracting foragers and pulling them underwater where they drown But the Northern Royals in particular are vulnerable because of their desire to nest only on the Chatham Islands sea stacks If one big storm rolls through at the wrong time of year it can severely dent breeding success In 1986 a huge storm washed waves over these 50m tall islands said Dr Scofield Jonathan Amos INTERNET bbc co uk and follow me on Twitter BBCAmos", "Share

dried sperm stored in the near weightless environment of space The Japanese team behind the gravity breaking experiment on the International Space Station ISS say it shows that transporting the seeds of life away from Earth is feasible Sperm banks could even be made on the Moon as a back up for Earth disasters they told a leading science journal It is unclear if this will ever help humans populate space however Sustaining life in space is challenging to say the least On the ISS radiation is more than 100 times higher than on Earth The average daily dose of 0 5mSv from the cosmic rays is enough to damage the DNA code inside living cells including sperm Microgravity also does strange things to sperm In 1988 German researchers sent a sample of bull semen into orbit on a rocket and discovered that sperm were able to swim much faster in low gravity although it was not clear whether this gave a fertility advantage Another space test showed fish eggs could be fertilised and develop normally during a 15 day orbital flight suggesting a brief trip into space might not be too harmful for reproduction at least for vertebrates The freeze dried mouse sperm samples were stored on the space station for nine months before being sent back down to Earth and thawed at room temperature Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reports Although sperm DNA was slightly damaged by the trip it still did the job of fertilising mouse eggs and creating apparently healthy space pups Fertilisation and birth rates were similar to healthy ground control mice The space pups had only minor differences in their genetic code and grew to adulthood A select few were allowed to mate and became mums and dads themselves The researchers Sayaka Wakayama and colleagues from the University of Yamanashi suspect some of the sperm DNA damage is repaired by the egg once it has been fertilised If sperm samples are to be preserved for longer periods in space then it is likely that DNA damage will increase and exceed the limit of the egg oocyte s capacity for repair If the DNA damage occurring during long term preservation is found to have a significant effect on offspring we will need to develop methods to protect sperm samples against space radiation such as an ice shield they said Once they ve cracked that they can set their sights on the Moon sperm banks Underground storage on the Moon such as in lava tubes could be among the best places for prolonged or permanent sperm preservation because of their very low temperatures protection from space radiation by thick bedrock layers and complete isolation from any disasters on Earth the scientists say But that still leaves the massive question of whether mammals including us humans can permanently live and procreate in space Mouse and human studies so far suggest perhaps not Prof Joseph Tash a Nasa supported physiologist at the University of Kansas Medical Center said although the latest findings were interesting the ISS was a somewhat sheltered environment to use as the test zone for space The ISS orbit is within the protection of the Van Allen radiation belt the magnetic field that diverts most high energy radiation particles from hitting the earth or the ISS He said the actual risk of radiation damage at the Moon and beyond would be much higher Ovaries and testes are the most sensitive organs to both acute and chronic radiation exposure He said the feasibility of mammalian reproduction in space beyond the Van Allen belt would depend on the creation of radiation hardened facilities that could protect sperm eggs and embryos from harm Given the nine month gestation for humans the pregnant mother would also need to be protected by such a facility So it presents very real habitat medical social and

prevention Researchers worked with a group of 66 incarcerated ex combatants from a paramilitary terrorist group in Colombia a country with one of the greatest insurgency rates in the world This unique experiment revealed what the team described as an abnormal pattern of moral judgment in terrorists The scientists say a psychological score based on this could be an accurate way to discriminate between the mindset of a terrorist and that of a non criminal The researchers based in Argentina the US Colombia and Chile published their findings in the journal Nature Human Behaviour Agust n Ibanez and Adolfo Garc a from Favaloro University in Buenos Aires who were part of the international research team told BBC News they had spent four years working with Colombian law enforcers to secure permission to work with this large group of dangerous incarcerated terrorists The study participants were former members of right wing paramilitary groups all of whom had been convicted of murder Many had been involved in massacres with hundreds of victims They took part in a series of psychological tests including an assessment of moral cognition This involved presenting the subjects with a series of scenarios in which characters either deliberately or accidentally caused harm to others Each subject was then asked to rate the scenario on a scale from totally forbidden 1 to totally permissible 7 Dr Ibanez said The typical response is that attempted harm should be more objected to than accidental harm But the pattern in terrorists was the opposite The pattern this research revealed was that extreme terrorists judge other people s actions by focusing on the outcomes of an action rather than its underlying intentions This is the first study to demonstrate this psychological trait and it suggests that a terrorist s moral code actually approves of any action if it contributes to achieving a given aim The researchers hope the conclusions could help build a psychological profile for use in forensics and law enforcement But they say further research will need specifically to examine how predictive this measure of moral cognition is when it comes to identifying dangerous insurgent individuals They also pointed out that there were likely to be differences in the origins and psychological traits of different forms of terrorism For example in the population we studied religion does not seem to be a relevant factor In fact most ex combatants in Colombia joined paramilitary groups for economic reasons because they were paid a salary But I would envisage forensic psychologists ultimately using a moral score like this to help assess how much of a threat a particular individual poses in addition to other measures of aggression and emotions as well as other cognitive and social tasks Dr Ibanez told BBC News Prof Seena Fazel from the University of Oxford a psychiatrist focusing on the relationship between mental illness and violent crime told BBC News that the study was a step forward He said there was value in the study s comparison of terrorists and non criminals the team carried out the same battery of tests on 66 healthy individuals from the same geographical region who had no terrorist background I d be interested in identifiable and modifiable factors that can either stop people repeating a violent act or stop them committing it in the first place That would be where research could be very useful These type of assessments rely on detailed interviews so we re not at a point where we could scale up and implement this Follow Victoria on Twitter",

Europe as a result of Brexit would harm scientific progress says a group of leading UK universities Science and research should be a priority in the talks between the UK and the EU says the Russell Group of research intensive universities Any barriers would be bad for the UK and bad for Europe said the group s acting director Tim Bradshaw His comments come as the EU prepares to authorise the start of the talks The EU s chief negotiator Michel Barnier is due later on Monday to seek a formal mandate from the European Council in Brussels to begin negotiations Mr Barnier expects the talks to begin immediately after June s general election The Russell Group says there will be no winners if Brexit results in barriers between researchers and has pledged to work with all sides to secure a positive outcome Dr Bradshaw said there had been huge breakthroughs in medicine engineering and any number of fields as a result of joint working which he promised would continue after Brexit We want to maintain the closest possible relationships with colleagues across the EU and research must be a priority during talks he added He called for the rights of EU students and staff at UK universities to be guaranteed after Brexit We value our EU colleagues very highly and need urgent assurances that after Brexit they will retain the same rights to stay and work in the UK that they have now Nearly half of all UK academic articles result from international collaboration and EU member states are some of our biggest partners These relationships improve the quality of UK research and underpin the strength of our science base UK universities are among the biggest beneficiaries of the EU s huge Horizon 2020 research fund Non EU countries can also draw on the fund if they contribute to it but a major condition of countries being able to participate is allowing freedom of movement for researchers a potential stumbling block in the talks The Conservative party manifesto promises to collaborate in science and innovation with EU member states The manifesto also pledges to secure the entitlements of EU nationals in Britain and British nationals in the EU There may be specific European programmes in which we might want to participate and if so it will be reasonable that we make a contribution the document adds Labour s manifesto promises that the party in government would ensure that the UK maintains our leading research role by seeking to stay part of Horizon 2020 and its successor programmes and by welcoming research staff to the UK The party also says it will seek to maintain membership or equivalent with European organisations that offer benefits to the UK such as Euratom and the European Medicines Agency The Liberal Democrat manifesto warns that the Leave vote has already started to affect existing and proposed research programmes We will campaign against any reduction in investment in UK universities and for their right to apply for EU funds on equal terms
